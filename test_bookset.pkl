But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He studies the riddles of everyday life\x97from cheating and crime to parenting and sports\x97and reaches conclusions that turn conventional wisdom on its head. <i>Freakonomics</i> is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They set out to explore the inner workings of a crack gang, the truth about real estate agents, the secrets of the Ku Klux Klan, and much more. Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, they show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives\x97how people get what they want or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. </p>'

S"<p>Are you a genius or a genius <i>maker</i>? </p><p>We've all had experience with two dramatically different types of leaders. The first type drain intelligence, energy, and capability from the ones around them and always need to be the smartest ones in the room. These are the idea killers, the energy sappers, the diminishers of talent and commitment. On the other side of the spectrum are leaders who use their intelligence to amplify the smarts and capabilities of the people around them. When these leaders walk into a room, lightbulbs go off over people's heads, ideas flow, and problems get solved. These are the leaders who inspire employees to stretch themselves to deliver results that surpass expectations. These are the Multipliers. And the world needs more of them, especially now, when leaders are expected to do more with less. </p><p>In this engaging and highly practical book, leadership expert Liz Wiseman and management consultant Greg McKeown explore these two leadership styles, persuasively showing how Multipliers can have a resoundingly positive and profitable effect on organizations\x97getting more done with fewer resources, developing and attracting talent, and cultivating new ideas and energy to drive organizational change and innovation. </p><p>In analyzing data from more than 150 leaders, Wiseman and McKeown have identified five disciplines that distinguish Multipliers from Diminishers. These five disciplines are not based on innate talent; indeed, they are skills and practices that everyone can learn to use\x97even lifelong and recalcitrant Diminishers. Lively, real-world case studies and practical tips and techniques bring to life each of these principles, showing you how to become a Multiplier too, whether you are a new or an experienced manager. Just imagine what you could accomplish if you could harness all the energy and intelligence around you. <i>Multipliers</i> will show you how. </p>"

p57
S'</p>Throughout history, rich and poor countries alike have been lending, borrowing, crashing--and recovering--their way through an extraordinary range of financial crises. Each time, the experts have chimed, "this time is different"--claiming that the old rules of valuation no longer apply and that the new situation bears little similarity to past disasters. This book proves that premise wrong. Covering sixty-six countries across five continents, </i>This Time Is Different</i> presents a comprehensive look at the varieties of financial crises, and guides us through eight astonishing centuries of government defaults, banking panics, and inflationary spikes--from medieval currency debasements to today\'s subprime catastrophe. Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff, leading economists whose work has been influential in the policy debate concerning the current financial crisis, provocatively argue that financial combustions are universal rites of passage for emerging and established market nations. The authors draw important lessons from history to show us how much--or how little--we have learned.</p></p> Using clear, sharp analysis and comprehensive data, Reinhart and Rogoff document that financial fallouts occur in clusters and strike with surprisingly consistent frequency, duration, and ferocity. They examine the patterns of currency crashes, high and hyperinflation, and government defaults on international and domestic debts--as well as the cycles in housing and equity prices, capital flows, unemployment, and government revenues around these crises. While countries do weather their financial storms, Reinhart and Rogoff prove that short memories make it all too easy for crises to recur.</p></p> An important book that will affect policy discussions for a long time to come, </i>This Time Is Different</i> exposes centuries of financial missteps.</p>'

S"In his #1 bestseller The Tipping Point, Malcolm Gladwell redefined how we understand the world around us. In BLINK, he revolutionizes the way we understand the world within.  How do we make decisions--good and bad--and why are some people so much better at it than others? That's the question Malcolm Gladwell asks and answers in BLINK. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, examining case studies as diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the New Coke, Gladwell shows how the difference between good decision making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but rather with the few particular details on which we focus.  BLINK displays all of the brilliance that has made Malcolm Gladwell's journalism so popular and his books such perennial bestsellers as it reveals how all of us can become better decision makers--in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life."

In a Pew Forum poll in the same year, 42 percent believed that all life on earth has existed in its present form since the beginning of time.</b>  <P> In 1859 Charles Darwin\'s masterpiece, <I>On the Origin of Species</i>, shook society to its core. Darwin was only too aware of the storm his theory of evolution would provoke. But he surely would have raised an incredulous eyebrow at the controversy still raging a century and a half later. Evolution is accepted as scientific fact by all reputable scientists and indeed theologians, yet millions of people continue to question its veracity. Now the author of the iconic work <I>The God Delusion</i> takes them to task.  <P> <I>The Greatest Show on Earth</i> is a stunning counterattack on advocates of "Intelligent Design," explaining the evidence for evolution while exposing the absurdities of the creationist "argument." Dawkins sifts through rich layers of scientific evidence: from living examples of natural selection to clues in the fossil record; from natural clocks that mark the vast epochs wherein evolution ran its course to the intricacies of developing embryos; from plate tectonics to molecular genetics. Combining these elements and many more, he makes the airtight case that "we find ourselves perched on one tiny twig in the midst of a blossoming and flourishing tree of life and it is no accident, but the direct consequence of evolution by non-random selection."  <P> <I>The Greatest Show on Earth</i> comes at a critical time: systematic opposition to the fact of evolution is menacing as never before. In American schools, and in schools around the world, insidious attempts are made to undermine the status of science in the classroom. Dawkins wields a devastating argument against this ignorance, but his unjaded passion for the natural world turns what might have been a negative argument into a positive offering to the reader: nothing less than a master\'s vision of life, in all its splendor.'

(S"Jim Cramer's Getting Back to Even"
p117
S'In his new book, Cramer offers the most detailed guidance he has ever given on how to invest in a changed market. Savvy investors will not just survive; they will thrive. Cramer begins with six rules for protecting the money you have and making sure that you have the money you need. (Rule Number 3: Skip the first four stages of portfolio grief: denial, anger, bargaining, and depression.) Your portfolio won\'t fix itself; you have to do that. It\'s easy to close your eyes and pretend that it all never happened, but you\'ll never get back to even that way, much less profit from the opportunities that this new market offers to investors who know where to put their money. One key to making investment decisions is to watch what the mutual-fund managers are doing and -- better yet -- to anticipate their moves. Cramer tells you how to do this. Their decisions will move markets, and you want to profit from these moves.<P>Cramer explains why dividends may be another key to picking winners in the post-crash stock market, and he introduces a category he calls the accidental high yielders -- stocks whose prices have taken a beating, boosting their yields. Some of these stocks could make a major move upward; Cramer tells you how to spot the ones that could take off.<P>For the first time in any of his books, Cramer offers a portfolio of twelve stocks that he says are poised to profit from the economic recovery. And he gives investors a list of five regional banks that could make big moves and return a handsome reward to shareholders. As always, Cramer explains why investors can\'t just take his word but have to "buy and homework" on these stocks to make sure that their stories don\'t change.<P>If you\'re near or in retirement, your opportunities to recover and profit are more limited than those of younger investors. Cramer tells you why stocks should still be an important part of your investment portfolio. And for younger investors, Cramer explains why you must take advantage of what could be a rare opportunity to buy stocks at fabulous prices and set up a terrific portfolio.<P>Cramer offers advanced tips for investors who have the time and are willing to invest it to profit from the post-crash stock market. Call options may seem like exotic and dangerous investment tools, but Cramer shows why they can be a conservative investing strategy that can bring quick returns in a recovering market. He explains how to use IPOs and secondary offerings wisely to juice your investment portfolio.<P>And as if all that weren\'t enough, Cramer has come up with twenty-five new rules for the post-crash market. (Rule Number 4: It pays to follow the <I>dumb</i> money.)<P><I>Getting Back to Even</i> is indispensable for any investor still reeling in shock from the 2008-2009 market collapse and wondering where to go from here. From investment strategies to specific stock recommendations, it\'s the foundation for the portfolios that will soar when the economic recovery takes hold.'

p131
S'Abandoning the format of workbooks-as-you-know-them, the <i>Wild at Heart Field Manual</i> takes men on a journey through which John Eldredge encourages them to be dangerous. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy:  To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk.  Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires, aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy."  It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death.  In this provocative book, Eldredge gives men permission to be what God designed them to be -- dangerous, passionate, alive, and free.  This book is filled with questions, exercises, journaling ideas, and guided exploration of the arts that will lead men on a journey to discover the masculine heart that God gave them.'

(S'The Flight of the Intellectuals'
p136
S'Twenty years ago, Ayatollah Khomeini called for the assassination of Salman Rushdie\x97and writers around the world instinctively rallied to Rushdie\x92s defense. Today, according to writer Paul Berman, \x93Rushdie has metastasized into an entire social class\x94\x97an ever-growing group of sharp-tongued critics of Islamist extremism, especially critics from Muslim backgrounds, who survive only because of pseudonyms and police protection. And yet, instead of being applauded, the Rushdies of today (people like Ayan Hirsi Ali and Ibn Warraq) often find themselves dismissed as \x93strident\x94 or as no better than fundamentalist themselves, and contrasted unfavorably with representatives of the Islamist movement who falsely claim to be \x93moderates.\x94  <br /><br />How did this happen? In THE FLIGHT OF THE INTELLECTUALS, Berman\x97\x93one of America\x92s leading public intellectuals\x94 (<em>Foreign Affairs</em>)\x97conducts a searing examination into the intellectual atmosphere of the moment and shows how some of the West\x92s best thinkers and journalists have fumbled badly in their efforts to grapple with Islamist ideas and violence.  <br /><br />Berman\x92s investigation of the history and nature of the Islamist movement includes some surprising revelations. In examining Hassan al-Banna, the founder of the Muslim Brotherhood, he shows the rise of an immense and often violent worldview, elements of which survives today in the brigades of al-Qaeda and Hamas. Berman also unearths the shocking story of al-Banna\x92s associate, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, who collaborated personally with Adolf Hitler to incite Arab support of the Nazis\x92 North African campaign. Echoes of the Grand Mufti\x92s Nazified Islam can be heard among the followers of al-Banna even today.  <br /><br />In a gripping and stylish narrative Berman also shows the legacy of these political traditions, most importantly by focusing on a single philosopher, who happens to be Hassan al-Banna\x92s grandson, Oxford professor Tariq Ramadan\x97a figure widely celebrated in the West as a \x93moderate\x94 despite his troubling ties to the Islamist movement. Looking closely into what Ramadan has actually written and said, Berman contrasts the reality of Ramadan with his image in the press.  <br /><br />In doing so, THE FLIGHT OF THE INTELLECTUALS sheds light on a number of modern issues\x97on the massively reinvigorated anti-Semitism of our own time, on a newly fashionable turn against women\x92s rights, and on the difficulties we have in discussing terrorism\x97and presents a stunning commentary about the modern media\x92s peculiar inability to detect and analyze some of the most dangerous ideas in contemporary society.'

S'The Christian faith is supposed to produce deep, positive change. So why doesn\'t it seem to work in "real life"? That question screamed at Pastor Peter Scazzero when his church and marriage hit bottom and every Christian remedy produced nothing but anger and fatigue. As he began digging under the "good Christian" veneer, he discovered entire emotional layers of his life that God had not yet touched. And that emotional immaturity had fed his spiritual immaturity. In this book, he unveils what\'s wrong with our conventional means of "spiritual growth" and offers not only a model of spirituality that actually works, but seven steps to transformation that will help readers experience a faith charged with authenticity, contemplation and a hunger for God.'

It is the ultimate book on how to stay alive-based on the principal of keeping the body\'s core temperature at a lively 98.6 degrees. In his entertaining and informative style, Cody stresses that a human can live without food for weeks, and without water for about three days or so. But if the body\'s core temperature dips much below or above the 98.6 degree mark, a person can literally die within hours. It is a concept that many don\'t take seriously or even consider, but knowing what to do to maintain a safe core temperature when lost in a blizzard or in the desert could save your life. Lundin delivers the message with wit, rebellious humor, and plenty of backcountry expertise.         <P>Cody Lundin and his Aboriginal Living Skills School have been featured in dozens of national and international media sources, including Dateline NBC, CBS News, USA Today, The Donny and Marie Show, and CBC Radio One in Canada, as well as on the cover of Backpacker magazine.

p254
S'Defending America, Flaws and All-America is under attack as never before-not only from terrorists but also from those who provide a rationale for terrorism. Islamic terrorists declare America the Great Satan, many Europeans complain about America spreading its cultural wasteland, and even here in our own country America is under attack by both the political left and right. In his new book, What\'s So Great About America, Dinesh D\'Souza proves the critics wrong and shows why America is still the greatest, freest, and most decent society in the world.    <P>In the aftermath of the September 11 attacks on our country, D\'Souza believes, a clear understanding of the moral basis of Western civilization is needed now more than ever. What\'s So Great About America offers a powerful defense for America and exposes the truth about who our enemies really are.     <P>D\'Souza challenges the widely held belief that the terrorists were cowards and lunatics. Rather, he says they were educated, deeply religious Muslims who gave up their own lives believing that Allah would reward them in heaven. In What\'s So Great About America, D\'Souza examines how Islam has become an incubator of fanaticism and terrorism.     <P>Many Americans are now asking, Why do they hate us? D\'Souza tackles this question by examining what he considers the three basic currents of opposition to America\'s global influence: the European critique, the Asian critique, and the Islamic critique. D\'Souza, who was raised in India, a country that was colonized by the West, understands firsthand the arguments for and against America. What\'s So Great About America presents a unique view-an immigrant\'s view of why America works.     <P>D\'Souza writes, "America is a new kind of society that produces a new kind of human being-confident, self-reliant, tolerant, generous, future-oriented-a vast improvement over the fatalistic and intolerant human beings that traditional societies have always produced, and Islamic societies produce now."     <P>In What\'s So Great About America, D\'Souza also takes on the critics here at home. He defends not an idealized America, but America as she really is. D\'Souza reassures us that we will not be seeing the "death of the West" or the triumphs of multiculturalism anytime soon.'

Most of us believe that at age 40 or so, we begin the slow and steady decline of our minds and bodies. According to Dr. Roizen and Dr. Oz, that's a mistake. Aging isn't a decline in our systems. It's actually very purposeful. The very systems and biological processes that age us are designed to help us when we're a little bit younger. Our role is to learn how those systems function so we can reprogram them to work the way they did when we were younger. Your goal should be: die young at any age. That means you live a high quality of life (with everything from working joints to working genitals) until the day you die.<P>At the core of <I>YOU: Staying Young</i> are the Major Agers -- 14 biological processes that control your rate of aging. Doctors Roizen and Oz explain the principles of longevity and many of the causes of aging and how to fight their effects.

S'Classic text and perennial best-seller expanded and revised.    <P>This new edition of Perfect Daughters, a pivotal book in the ACoA movement, identifies what differentiates the adult daughters of alcoholics from other women.     <P>When this groundbreaking book first appeared over ten years ago, Dr. Ackerman identified behavior patterns shared by daughters of alcoholics. Adult daughters of alcoholics-"perfect daughters" -operate from a base of harsh and limiting views of themselves and the world. Having learned that they must function perfectly in order to avoid unpleasant situations, these women often assume responsibility for the failures of others. They are drawn to chemically dependent men and are more likely to become addicted themselves. More than just a text that identifies these behavior patterns, this book collects the thoughts, feelings and experiences of twelve hundred perfect daughters, offering readers an opportunity to explore their own life\'s dynamics and thereby heal and grow.    <P>This edition contains updated information throughout the text, and completely new material, including chapters on eating disorders and abuse letters from perfect daughters in various stages of recovery, and helpful, affirming suggestions from Dr. Ackerman at the end of every chapter. This book is essential for every one who found validation, hope, courage and support in the pages of the original Perfect Daughters, as well as new readers and every therapist who confronts these issues.     <P>Also includes: a comprehensive reference section and complete index.'

p552
S'In this epic, beautifully written masterwork, Pulitzer Prize\x96winning author Isabel Wilkerson chronicles one of the great untold stories of American history: the decades-long migration of black citizens who fled the South for northern and western cities, in search of a better life. From 1915 to 1970, this exodus of almost six million people changed the face of America. Wilkerson compares this epic migration to the migrations of other peoples in history. She interviewed more than a thousand people, and gained access to new data and official records, to write this definitive and vividly dramatic account of how these American journeys unfolded, altering our cities, our country, and ourselves.<br>\xa0<br>With stunning historical detail, Wilkerson tells this story through the lives of three unique individuals: Ida Mae Gladney, who in 1937 left sharecropping and prejudice in Mississippi for Chicago, where she achieved quiet blue-collar success and, in old age, voted for Barack Obama when he ran for an Illinois Senate seat; sharp and quick-tempered George Starling, who in 1945 fled Florida for Harlem, where he endangered his job fighting for civil rights, saw his family fall, and finally found peace in God; and Robert Foster, who left Louisiana in 1953 to pursue a medical career, the personal physician to Ray Charles as part of a glitteringly successful medical career, which allowed him to purchase a grand home where he often threw exuberant parties.<br><br>Wilkerson brilliantly captures their first treacherous and exhausting cross-country trips by car and train and their new lives in colonies that grew into ghettos, as well as how they changed these cities with southern food, faith, and culture and improved them with discipline, drive, and hard work. Both a riveting microcosm and a major assessment, <b>The Warmth of Other Suns</b> is a bold, remarkable, and riveting work, a superb account of an \x93unrecognized immigration\x94 within our own land. Through the breadth of its narrative, the beauty of the writing, the depth of its research, and the fullness of the people and lives portrayed herein, this book is destined to become a classic.'

S'<B> From the <I>New York Times</I>-bestselling author who sets the standard for intense, powerful crime-writing comes a blistering thriller featuring Joe Pike and Elvis Cole. </B><BR><BR> <I>The Watchman</I> put Joe Pike, Elvis Cole\'s strong, taciturn partner, front and center, and not only won Robert Crais new audiences but remarkable reviews. The <I>South Florida Sun-Sentinel</I> said "Robert Crais elevates crime fiction" and now with <I>The First Rule</I> he does it again. <BR><BR> The organized criminal gangs of the former Soviet Union are bound by what they call the thieves\' code. The first rule is this: A thief must forsake his mother, father, brothers, and sisters. He must have no family-no wife, no children. We are his family. If any of the rules are broken, it is punishable by death. <BR><BR> Frank Meyer had the American dream-until the day a professional crew invaded his home and murdered everyone inside. The only thing out of the ordinary about Meyer was that- before the family and the business and the normal life-a younger Frank Meyer had worked as a professional mercenary, with a man named Joe Pike. The police think Meyer was hiding something very bad, but Pike does not. With the help of Cole, he sets out on a hunt of his own-an investigation that quickly entangles them both in a web of ancient grudges, blood ties, blackmail, vengeance, double crosses, and cutthroat criminal\xadity, and at the heart of it, an act so terrible even Pike and Cole have no way to measure it. Sometimes, the past is never dead. It\'s not even past. <BR><BR> <I>The First Rule</I> is the most astonishing novel yet from the master of the crime thriller. <BR><BR>'

p607
S'<p>Since Darwin\'s day, we\'ve been told that sexual monogamy comes naturally to our species. Mainstream science\x97as well as religious and cultural institutions\x97has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man\'s possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman\'s fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.</p><p>How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can\'t be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\xc1. While debunking almost everything we "know" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.</p><p>Ryan and Jeth\xc1\'s central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.</p><p>With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jeth\xc1 show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality. </p><p>In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, <i>Sex at Dawn</i> unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.</p>'

p617
S'<p>Audrey Hepburn is an icon like no other, yet the image many of us have of Audrey\x97dainty, immaculate\x97is anything but true to life. Here, for the first time, Sam Wasson presents the woman behind the little black dress that rocked the nation in 1961. The first complete account of the making of <i>Breakfast at Tiffany\'s</i>, <i>Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.</i> reveals little-known facts about the cinema classic: Truman Capote desperately wanted Marilyn Monroe for the leading role; director Blake Edwards filmed multiple endings; Hepburn herself felt very conflicted about balancing the roles of mother and movie star. With a colorful cast of characters including Truman Capote, Edith Head, Givenchy, "Moon River" composer Henry Mancini, and, of course, Hepburn herself, Wasson immerses us in the America of the late fifties before Woodstock and birth control, when a not-so-virginal girl by the name of Holly Golightly raised eyebrows across the country, changing fashion, film, and sex for good. Indeed, cultural touchstones like <i>Sex and the City</i> owe a debt of gratitude to <i>Breakfast at Tiffany\'s</i>. </p><p>In this meticulously researched gem of a book, Wasson delivers us from the penthouses of the Upper East Side to the pools of Beverly Hills, presenting <i>Breakfast at Tiffany\'s</i> as we have never seen it before\x97through the eyes of those who made it. Written with delicious prose and considerable wit, <i>Fifth Avenue, 5 A.M.</i> shines new light on a beloved film and its incomparable star.</p>'

In 2008, near the end of a brief climbing season cut even shorter by bad weather, no fewer than ten international teams\x97some experienced, others less prepared\x97crowded the mountain's dangerous slopes with their Sherpas and porters, waiting to ascend.</p><p>Finally, on August 1, they were able to set off. But hindered by poor judgment, lack of equipment, and overcrowded conditions, the last group did not summit until nearly 8 p.m., hours later than planned. Then disaster struck when a huge ice chunk from above the Bottleneck, a deadly 300-foot avalanche-prone gulley just below the summit, came loose and destroyed the fixed guide ropes. More than a dozen climbers and porters still above the Bottleneck\x97many without oxygen and some with no headlamps\x97faced the near impossibility of descending in the blackness with no guideline and no protection. Over the course of the chaotic night, some would miraculously make it back. Others would not. </p><p>Based on in-depth interviews with surviving climbers and many Sherpas, porters, and family and friends of the deceased, <i>No Way Down</i> reveals for the first time the full dimensions of this harrowing drama.</p>"

Those warnings went mostly unheeded; now, he insists, we need to acknowledge that we\'ve waited too long, and that massive change is not only unavoidable but already under way. Our old familiar globe is suddenly melting, drying, acidifying, flooding, and burning in ways that no human has ever seen. We\'ve created, in very short order, a new planet, still recognizable but fundamentally different. We may as well call it Eaarth.</P><P>That new planet is filled with new binds and traps. A changing world costs large sums to defend\x97think of the money that went to repair New Orleans, or the trillions it will take to transform our energy systems. But the endless economic growth that could underwrite such largesse depends on the stable planet we\'ve managed to damage and degrade. We can\'t rely on old habits any longer.</P><P>Our hope depends, McKibben argues, on scaling back\x97on building the kind of societies and economies that can hunker down, concentrate on essentials, and create the type of community (in the neighborhood, but also on the Internet) that will allow us to weather trouble on an unprecedented scale.

Instead, they are asking questions. The problem is the search for answers only leads parents to conflicting, one-sided information: doctors claim that parents are endangering their child's life if they refuse shots, while radical vaccine opponents claim parents are endangering their child's life if they accept shots. With THE VACCINE BOOK, parents finally have one, fair, impartial, fact-based resource they can turn to for answers. Each chapter is devoted to a disease/vaccine pair and offer a comprehensive discussion of what the disease is, how common or rare it is, how serious or harmless it is, the ingredients of the vaccine, and any possible side effects from the vaccine. Ultimately, parents will have to make their own informed decisions as Dr. Bob Sears is neither pro-vaccine nor anti-vaccine. But THE VACCINE BOOK will provide exactly the information parents want and need as they make their way through the vaccination maze.</strong>"

p722
S'<strong>W. G. Sebald called Robert Walser \x93a clairvoyant of the small,\x94 and nowhere is the phrase more apt than in his \x93microscripts.\x94</strong>  Robert Walser wrote many of his manuscripts in a highly enigmatic, shrunken-down form. These narrow strips of paper (many of them written during his hospitalization in the Waldau sanatorium) covered with tiny ant-like markings only a millimeter or two high, came to light only after the author\x92s death in 1956.  At first considered a secret code, the microscripts were eventually discovered to be a radically miniaturized form of a German script: a whole story could fit on the back of a business card.<br />  <br />  Selected from the six-volume German transcriptions from the original microscripts, these 25 short pieces are gathered in this gorgeously illustrated co-publication with the Christine Burgin Gallery.\xa0 Each microscript is reproduced in full color in its original form: the detached cover of a trashy crime novel, a disappointing letter, a receipt of payment. Sometimes Walser used the pages of small tear-off calendars (but only after cutting them lengthwise and filling up each half with text). Schnapps, rotten husbands, small town life, the radio, pigs (and how none of us can deny being one), jealousy, Van Gogh and marriage proposals are some of Walser\x92s subjects.\xa0 These texts take strength from Walser\x92s motto: \x93To be small and to stay small.\x94 65 full-color illustrations'

One can scarcely imagine what American society would look like without the abolitionists, feminists, socialists, union organizers, civil-rights workers, gay and lesbian activists, and environmentalists who have fought stubbornly to breathe life into the promises of freedom and equality that lie at the heart of American democracy.     <P>The first anthology of its kind, <I>The Radical Reader</I> brings together more than 200 primary documents in a comprehensive collection of the writings of America\'s native radical tradition. Spanning the time from the colonial period to the twenty-first century, the documents have been drawn from a wealth of sources??peeches, manifestos, newspaper editorials, literature, pamphlets, and private letters. From Thomas Paine\'s "Common Sense" to Kate Millett\'s "Sexual Politics," these are the documents that sparked, guided, and distilled the most influential movements in American history. Brief introductory essays by the editors provide a rich biographical and historical context for each selection included.    <P>Includes:   <BR>?? <I>Common Sense</I>, Thomas Paine  <BR>?? <I>Second Inaugural Address</I>, Abraham Lincoln  <BR>?? <I>Confession</I>, Nat Turner  <BR>?? <I>Last Speech to the Jury</I>, John Brown  <BR>?? <I>Letters on the Equality of the Sexes</I>, Sarah Grimke  <BR>?? <I>Declaration of Sentiments and Resolutions</I>, Seneca Falls Convention  <BR>?? <I>Life in the Iron Mills</I>, Rebecca Harding Davis  <BR>?? <I>Speech to Striking Coal Miners</I>, Mother Jones  <BR>?? <I>Letter from Birmingham Jail</I>, Martin Luther King, Jr.  <BR>?? <I>The Ballot or the Bullet</I>, Malcolm X  <BR>?? <I>The Feminine Mystique</I>, Betty Friedan  <BR>?? <I>Silent Spring</I>, Rachel Carson'

She thoughtfully emphasizes the basic strengths that we need in these changing times and then outlines what our schools must do to respond to 21st-century learning needs. Linda is one of the education researchers whom I most respect. 'All children' must mean all children and this book shows us how to do it.''<br><br><b>-Richard W. Riley,</b> Former U. S. Secretary of Education <br><br><br><br>''When Linda Darling-Hammond speaks, America's teachers listen! I listened and learned from her as we together led the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards and created the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future. Excellent schools are the key to America's economic future, and superb teaching is the key to great schools. This book makes clear as a bell how to organize schools for successful teaching and what state and national policies are required to support it.''<br><br></b>-James B. Hunt,</b> Former Governor of North Carolina and President of the Hunt Institute<br><br><br><br>''Her arguments are sound, rooted in evidence, and unencumbered by the kinds of ideological partisanship that characterizes too much of current educational debates.

Noguera,</b> Metropolitan Center for Urban Education, New York University<br><br><br><br>''Once again Darling-Hammond brings clarity to complexity, thoughtful analysis to politically charged issues, and sound policy recommendations to the hysteria of what to do to save America s public schools. In this volume the macro meets the micro on terms that lets all democratically-minded citizens breathe a sigh of relief.''<br><br><b>-Gloria Ladson-Billings,</b> University of Wisconsin Madison<br><br><br><br>''Anyone who desires a quantum leap in the educational achievements of American students-as opposed to the 'quick fix'-must address the issues raised in this carefully argued and well documented work.''<br><br><b>-Howard Gardner,</b> Harvard Graduate School of Education<br><br><br><br>''Linda Darling-Hammond has written the definitive description of the problems that drag down the quality and equity of our educational system.

p746
S'<DIV>What had happened to my beautiful boy? To our family? What did I do wrong? Those are the wrenching questions that haunted every moment of David Sheff\x92s journey through his son Nic\x92s addiction to drugs and tentative steps toward recovery. Before Nic Sheff became addicted to crystal meth, he was a charming boy, joyous and funny, a varsity athlete and honor student adored by his two younger siblings. After meth, he was a trembling wraith who lied, stole, and lived on the streets. David Sheff traces the first subtle warning signs: the denial, the 3 A.M. phone calls (is it Nic? the police? the hospital?), the rehabs. His preoccupation with Nic became an addiction in itself, and the obsessive worry and stress took a tremendous toll. But as a journalist, he instinctively researched every avenue of treatment that might save his son and refused to give up on Nic.<br>Beautiful Boy is a fiercely candid memoir that brings immediacy to the emotional rollercoaster of loving a child who seems beyond help.<br><br></DIV>'

S"One of the most extraordinary survival stories ever told -- Aron Ralston's searing account of his six days trapped in one of the most remote spots in America, and how one inspired act of bravery brought him home. <P> It started out as a simple hike in the Utah canyonlands on a warm Saturday afternoon. For Aron Ralston, a twenty-seven-year-old mountaineer and outdoorsman, a walk into the remote Blue John Canyon was a chance to get a break from a winter of solo climbing Colorado's highest and toughest peaks. He'd earned this weekend vacation, and though he met two charming women along the way, by early afternoon he finally found himself in his element: alone, with just the beauty of the natural world all around him. <P> It was 2:41 P.M. Eight miles from his truck, in a deep and narrow slot canyon, Aron was climbing down off a wedged boulder when the rock suddenly, and terrifyingly, came loose. Before he could get out of the way, the falling stone pinned his right hand and wrist against the canyon wall. <P> And so began six days of hell for Aron Ralston. With scant water and little food, no jacket for the painfully cold nights, and the terrible knowledge that he'd told no one where he was headed, he found himself facing a lingering death -- trapped by an 800-pound boulder 100 feet down in the bottom of a canyon. As he eliminated his escape options one by one through the days, Aron faced the full horror of his predicament: By the time any possible search and rescue effort would begin, he'd most probably have died of dehydration, if a flash flood didn't drown him before that. <P> What does one do in the face of almost certain death? Using the video camera from his pack, Aron began recording his grateful good-byes to his family and friends all over the country, thinking back over a life filled with adventure, and documenting a last will and testament with the hope that someone would find it. (For their part, his family and friends had instigated a major search for Aron, the amazing details of which are also documented here for the first time.) The knowledge of their love kept Aron Ralston alive, until a divine inspiration on Thursday morning solved the riddle of the boulder. Aron then committed the most extreme act imaginable to save himself. <P> <I>Between a Rock and a Hard Place</I> -- a brilliantly written, funny, honest, inspiring, and downright astonishing report from the line where death meets life -- will surely take its place in the annals of classic adventure stories."

S'<strong>The #1 <em>New York Times</em> bestseller: a brilliant account\x97character-rich and darkly humorous\x97of how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff.</strong>  When the crash of the U. S. stock market became public knowledge in the fall of 2008, it was already old news. The real crash, the silent crash, had taken place over the previous year, in bizarre feeder markets where the sun doesn\x92t shine, and the SEC doesn\x92t dare, or bother, to tread: the bond and real estate derivative markets where geeks invent impenetrable securities to profit from the misery of lower- and middle-class Americans who can\x92t pay their debts. The smart people who understood what was or might be happening were paralyzed by hope and fear; in any case, they weren\x92t talking.<br />  <br />  The crucial question is this: Who understood the risk inherent in the assumption of ever-rising real estate prices, a risk compounded daily by the creation of those arcane, artificial securities loosely based on piles of doubtful mortgages?  Michael Lewis turns the inquiry on its head to create a fresh, character-driven narrative brimming with indignation and dark humor, a fitting sequel to his #1 best-selling <em>Liar\x92s Poker</em>. Who got it right? he asks. Who saw the real estate market for the black hole it would become, and eventually made billions of dollars from that perception? And what qualities of character made those few persist when their peers and colleagues dismissed them as Chicken Littles? Out of this handful of unlikely\x97really unlikely\x97heroes, Lewis fashions a story as compelling and unusual as any of his earlier bestsellers, proving yet again that he is the finest and funniest chronicler of our times.'

p796
S'A psychologist with a reputation for penetrating to the heart of complex parenting issues joins forces with a physician and bestselling author to tackle one of the most disturbing and misunderstood trends of our time -- peers replacing parents in the lives of our children.<br><br>Dr. Neufeld has dubbed this phenomenon peer orientation, which refers to the tendency of children and youth to look to their peers for direction: for a sense of right and wrong, for values, identity and codes of behaviour. But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until <b>Hold On to Your Kids</b>. Once understood, it becomes self-evident -- as do the solutions.<br><br><b>Hold On to Your Kids</b> will restore parenting to its natural intuitive basis and the parent-child relationship to its rightful preeminence. The concepts, principles and practical advice contained in <b>Hold On to Your Kids </b>will empower parents to satisfy their children\x92s inborn need to find direction by turning towards a source of authority, contact and warmth.<br><br><br><i>Something has changed. One can sense it, one can feel it, just not find the words for it. Children are not quite the same as we remember being. They seem less likely to take their cues from adults, less inclined to please those in charge, less afraid of getting into trouble. Parenting, too, seems to have changed. Our parents seemed more confident, more certain of themselves and had more impact on us, for better or for worse. For many, parenting does not feel natural. Adults through the ages have complained about children being less respectful of their elders and more difficult to manage than preceding generations, but could it be that this time it is for real?</i> -- from <b>Hold On to Your Kids</b><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

In If the Devil Had a Wife, there is still the battle of Good vs. Evil, a beautiful maiden, a wealthy suitor, a kingdom of riches and the wicked witch, but any similarity with Cinderella and Snow White ends there.  With the help of her life partner and an attorney (always necessary in these modern times), Nelda Stark executes a devious plan that elevates fraud and theft to a new high.  A massive coverup reaches into the Texas Attorney General's Office, stealing from not only the Stark family, but the federal and state governments."

p811
S"This book is the fruit of Fr. Dubay's many years of study and experience in spiritual direction and in it he synthesizes the teachings on prayer of the two great doctors of the Church on prayer--St. John of the Cross and St. Teresa of Avila--and the teaching of Sacred Scripture.     <P>But the teaching that Fr. Dubay synthesized is not collected from Teresa and John for contemplatives alone. It is meant for every Christian and is based on the Gospel imperative of personal prayer and the call to holiness. All the major elements of these great teachers are ordered, commented on and put in the context of their scriptural foundations. Here is an outstanding book on prayer and the spiritual life written by one of the best spiritual directors and retreat masters of our time, and based on the writings of the Church's two greatest mystical doctors."

Using anecdotes and stories from his own life experiences, and from other companies, Hsieh provides concrete ways that companies can achieve unprecedented success.  He details many of the unique practices at Zappos, such as their philosophy of allocating marketing money into the customer experience, the importance of Zappos\'s Core Values ("Deliver WOW through Service"), and the reason why Zappos\'s number one priority is company culture and his belief that once you get the culture right, everything else - great customer service, long-term branding - will happen on its own. Finally, Delivering Happiness explains how Zappos employees actually apply the Core Values to improving their lives outside of work, proving that creating happiness and record results go hand-in-hand.'

On the windswept, fossil-strewn beaches of the English coast, she learns that she has "the eye"-and finds what no one else can see. When Mary uncovers an unusual fossilized skeleton in the cliffs near her home, she sets the religious fathers on edge, the townspeople to vicious gossip, and the scientific world alight.

(S'WALKING INTO MURDER (The Professor Laura Morland Mystery Series)'
p851
S"Who would believe that an innocent walking trip in the English Cotswolds would include not just one murder but three, and even more hair-raising adventures? The intrepid American heroine of WALKING INTO MURDER, professor Laura Morland, would have scoffed at the idea. All she wanted was a few days of peace to recover from a humiliating (if not entirely unwelcome) divorce and a chance to test her new independence. That she certainly does; peace is another matter.<br><br>WALKING INTO MURDER is a light-hearted mystery with a delightful setting, an intriguing plot and distinctive characters headed by Laura Morland, a wonderfully appealing new amateur detective. It is part traditional English mystery, part middle-aged female sleuth of independent spirit who solves mysteries that confound the experts, part primer on the the battle between the sexes since Laura is an expert on gender, part rousing adventure. Laura is hardly Miss Marple - she is younger, more active, attractive, even romantically inclined, but the settings and characters are very British indeed. <br><br>It's a wonderful read: spine-tingling escapes  and confrontations on deserted moors contrast with peaceful interludes in England's quaintest villages and most verdant countryside - and with some near-comic scenes of Laura's inept but ultimately successful efforts to track down the villains even as she eludes their clutches. Mask-making, amateur theatrics, underground tunnels and an escape from a boarded-up cottage are all part of the action.<br> <br>The adventure begins when Laura is invited to teach a seminar on gender issues in London. First she decides to embark on a solo walking trip on the Cotswold Way. The walk soon takes stormy turns. A  man plummets out of the thick mist, hauls her into an embrace and begs her to masquerade as his wife. Escorted at gunpoint by an aristocratic Englishman to an ancient manor house, she is confronted by a roomful of eccentrics, any of whom could be the killer of the body she finds in a bedroom - a body that perversely keeps changing its identity. In fact, everyone in in this bizarre household seems to have multiple identities and multiple motivations, making it exceedingly difficult to determine who is telling the truth and even harder to ascertain who is on Laura's side.<br><br>Curiosity is Laura's dominant trait and she delves into the mystery with possibly unwise abandon. She is determined to unmask the murderer - and to get the best of her alternately charming and irritating would-be husband, to whom she is undeniably attracted. She soon discovers that her fund of scholarly knowledge about male/female relationships is of little help in dealing with a man who refuses to answer her questions, appears to be having a steamy affair with the titled Lady of the house, and who increasingly seems the most likely candidate for murderer. Complicating matters further is his fraught relationship with Laura's able assistant in crime-detection, a fiery, free-spirited runaway who lives in the woods.<br><br>As Laura probes deeper, the efforts of the villains to silence her become more frantic and her strategies to evade them more ingenious.  With total disregard for the escalating danger, she vows to outwit them all. And she does. In a final dramatic - and totally unexpected - scene, she zeroes in on the killer, or it might be more accurate to say the murderer zeroes in on her.<br><br>Joan Dahr Lambert is the author of CIRCLES OF STONE, a prehistoric novel told through the eyes of three women who became leaders of their tribes, and published by Simon & Schuster in 1997 & 1999. Lambert has written two other prehistoric novels, a novel about wolves for children and a novella, as well as the first two books in the Laura Morland series. The second, BABES IN THE BATHS, will be out soon.  Like may published authors, she has  decided to try self-publishing. All of her books will soon appear on Kindle and on other on-line venues."

He tries to stay upbeat: \'I don\'t want to stay in the bad place, where no one believes in silver linings or love or happy endings . . . but I am also afraid the people from my old life will not be as enthusiastic as I am now trying to be.\' His mother sets him up with a therapist, Dr. Patel. The first hint at a reason for apart time appears in the doctor\'s waiting room, when Pat hears <I>Songbird</I> by Kenny G, and the \'evil bright soprano saxophone\' sends him into a rage, screaming, flipping over chairs, yelling at the receptionist. But Pat likes Dr. Patel, who turns out to be a major Philadelphia Eagles fan?he goes to tailgate parties in a bus labeled \'Asian Invasion\' with a portrait of Brian Dawkins painted on the hood. Being an Eagles fan is important to Pat, whose father\'s moods revolve around the team. He also witnesses his mother\'s pain, as she waits to see what temper her husband will be in based on a game\'s outcome. His father\'s mania is not unusual in Philadelphia, where Eagles fandom is a blood sport, something Pat gets caught up in at a tailgate party, when he attacks a Giants fan while defending his brother Jake. Soon after his move back home, Pat is befriended in an odd and cautious way by Tiffany, who silently waits for Pat when he comes out to run (he works out 10 hours a day), and follows him at a distance. They begin a wary alliance, and she tells him she\'s scouting his work ethic, his endurance and his ability to persevere, but won\'t tell him why. Friendship, family, connection and discovery intertwine in a marvelous way in this appealing novel. Pat thinks that just when a movie\'s main character believes all is lost, something surprising happens, leading to a happy ending, so he continues to hope that he\'ll be reunited with Nikki, that God will not let him down. As Pat doggedly practices being kind rather than right, grace enters his life in unexpected ways (\'Miracles happen on Christmas, Pat. Everybody knows that the.\'), and he realizes that life is not a movie. In refusing to be defeated by pessimism, Pat learns about true silver linings, not pretty happy endings."?<B>Marilyn Dahl, <I>Shelf Awareness<BR><BR></I></B>"[A] touching and funny debut . . .

Sadly, when women grow up, they are taught to be tough, efficient, and independent. Many Christian women are tired, struggling under the weight of the pressure to be a "good servant," a nurturing caregiver, passionate lover, or capable home manager.</p>  <p>What the <em>Wild at Heart Field Manual</em> did for men, the <em>Captivating: A Guided Journal</em> can do for women.

This country is in an economically wobbly, terror-filled time where Americans have kept close to home both literally and figuratively. The 75th Anniversary Edition of the Joy of Cooking -- as it has always done -- speaks to the time it is published into. This Joy has come full circle from 1997 with a huge emphasis on American home cooking. We are not chasing the authentic Oaxacan enchilada here -- we have cheese, chicken, and beef. We have returned the casserole; included slow cooker recipes; restored chapters on jams, jellies, pickles, ice cream, and drinks. There is an eye to economy with expanded discussions on how to get the best out of tougher cuts of meat; the art of leftovers; and keeping household stock. With 500 completely new recipes and hundreds of recipes long edited out of previous editions, this is a brand-new, best-loved Joy of Cooking that rejoices in the cooking of the country that made it the bestselling cookbook of all time -- America.    <P>BACK TO BASICS  The perfect boiled egg*fluffy rice*pancakes light as air*choosing the perfect cut of meat* no fail cakes* knife skills* vegetables for every meal*cooking with fresh herbs*how to cook fish*roast chicken with crispy skin*fresh salads and homemade dressings*crisp fritters, fries, and onion rings* casserole cooking*finding the right sauce for the pasta*easy homemade pie dough*simple stock making*chewy and cakey cookies and brownies*quick pan sauces for meats    <P>BRAND NEW  A return to the American classics from enchiladas and chop suey to velvet cake and mud pie* all new illustrations*rich new soups*more grilling recipes*homemade ice cream and sorbet*slow cooker recipes*complete new grains*food for a crowd*how to freeze ingredients, dishes and entire meals*beverages and party drinks for entertaining and family meals* making jellies, jams and preserves* how to can fruits and vegetables*quick suppers*brining meats and shellfish    <P>RETURN TO REFERENCE  Cutting-edge nutritional information*Expanded Know Your Ingredients*More information about storing and keeping foods*more menu planning*new illustrations of techniques*new sections on high altitude baking and cooking*cooking with wine and spirits*stocking your pantry*buying the right equipment*expanded index*botanical information*ingredient substitutions*expanded information on fish and game*entertaining how-to from supper clubs to children's parties"

(S'A Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations: Chicago Style for Students and Researchers'
p975
S'Dewey. Bellow. Strauss. Friedman. The University of Chicago has been the home of some of the most important thinkers of the modern age. But perhaps no name has been spoken with more respect than Turabian. The dissertation secretary at Chicago for decades, Kate Turabian literally wrote the book on the successful completion and submission of the student paper. Her Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations, created from her years of experience with research projects across all fields, has sold more than seven million copies since it was first published in 1937.   Now, with this seventh edition, Turabian\x92s Manual has undergone its most extensive revision, ensuring that it will remain the most valuable handbook for writers at every level\x97from first-year undergraduates, to dissertation writers apprehensively submitting final manuscripts, to senior scholars who may be old hands at research and writing but less familiar with new media citation styles. Gregory G. Colomb, Joseph M. Williams, and the late Wayne C. Booth\x97the gifted team behind The Craft of Research\x97and the University of Chicago Press Editorial Staff combined their wide-ranging expertise to remake this classic resource. They preserve Turabian\x92s clear and practical advice while fully embracing the new modes of research, writing, and source citation brought about by the age of the Internet.  Booth, Colomb, and Williams significantly expand the scope of previous editions by creating a guide, generous in length and tone, to the art of research and writing. Growing out of the authors\x92 best-selling Craft of Research, this new section provides students with an overview of every step of the research and writing process, from formulating the right questions to reading critically to building arguments and revising drafts. This leads naturally to the second part of the Manual for Writers, which offers an authoritative overview of citation practices in scholarly writing, as well as detailed information on the two main citation styles (\x93notes-bibliography\x94 and \x93author-date\x94). This section has been fully revised to reflect the recommendations of the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style and to present an expanded array of source types and updated examples, including guidance on citing electronic sources.  The final section of the book treats issues of style\x97the details that go into making a strong paper. Here writers will find advice on a wide range of topics, including punctuation, table formatting, and use of quotations. The appendix draws together everything writers need to know about formatting research papers, theses, and dissertations and preparing them for submission. This material has been thoroughly vetted by dissertation officials at colleges and universities across the country.  This seventh edition of Turabian\x92s Manual for Writers of Research Papers, Theses, and Dissertations is a classic reference revised for a new age. It is tailored to a new generation of writers using tools its original author could not have imagined\x97while retaining the clarity and authority that generations of scholars have come to associate with the name Turabian.'

(S'Broke: The Plan to Restore Our Trust, Truth and Treasure'
p985
S'<P>THE FACTS. <P>THE FUTURE. <P>THE FIGHT TO FIX AMERICA\x97 <P>BEFORE IT\x92S TOO LATE. <P>In the words of Harvard historian Niall Ferguson, the United States is \x93an empire on the edge of chaos.\x94 Why? Glenn Beck thinks the answer is pretty simple: Because we\x92ve turned our backs on the Constitution. <P>Yes, our country is financially broke, but that\x92s just a side effect of our broken spirit, our broken faith in government, the broken promises by our leaders, and a broken political system that has centralized power at the expense of individual rights. <P>There is a lot of work ahead, but we can\x92t move forward until we first understand how we got here. Starting with the American Revolution, Glenn takes readers on an express train through 234 years of history, culminating with the Great Recession and the bipartisan recklessness of Presidents Bush and Obama. It\x92s the history lesson we all wished we\x92d had in school. (Did you know, for example, that FDR once made a key New Deal policy decision based on his lucky number?) <P>Along the way, you\x92ll see how everything you thought you knew about the political parties is a lie, how Democrats and Republicans alike used to fight for minimum government and maximum freedom, and how both parties have been taken over by a cancer called \x93progressivism.\x94 By the end, you\x92ll understand why no president, no congress and no court can fix this problem alone. Looking toward them for answers is like looking toward the ocean for drinking water\x97 it looks promising, but the end result is catastrophic. <P>After revealing the trail of lies that brought us here, <I>Broke </i>exposes the truth about what we\x92re really facing. Most people have seen pieces of the puzzle, but very few have ever seen the whole picture\x97and for very good reason: Our leaders have done everything in their power to hide it. If Americans understood how dire things really are, they would be demanding radical reform right now. Despite the rhetoric, that\x92s not the kind of change our politicians really believe in. <P>Finally, <I>Broke </i>provides the hope that comes with knowing the truth. Once you see what we\x92re really up against, it\x92s much easier to develop a realistic plan. To fix ourselves financially, Glenn argues, we have to fix <I>ourselves </i>first. That means some serious introspection and, ultimately, a series of actions that will unite all Americans around the concept of shared sacrifice. After all, this generation may not be asked to storm beaches, but we are being asked to do something just as critical to preserving freedom. <P>Packed with great stories from history, chalkboard-style teachable moments, custom illustrations, and Glenn Beck\x92s trademark combination of entertainment and enlightenment, <I>Broke </i>makes the case that when you\x92re traveling in the wrong direction, slight course corrections won\x92t cut it\x97you need to take drastic action. Through a return to individual rights, an uncompromising adherence to the Constitution, and a complete rethinking about the role of government in a free society, Glenn exposes the idea of \x93transformation\x94 for the progressive smokescreen that it is, and instead builds a compelling case that restoration is the only way forward.'

(S'Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard'
p995
S'<b>Why is it so hard to make lasting changes in our companies, in our communities, and in our own lives?</b><br><br>The primary obstacle is a conflict that\x92s built into our brains, say Chip and Dan Heath, authors of the critically acclaimed bestseller\xa0<i>Made to Stick</i>. Psychologists have discovered that our minds are ruled by two different systems\x97the rational mind and the emotional mind\x97that compete for control. The rational mind wants a great beach body; the emotional mind wants that Oreo cookie. The rational mind wants to change something at work; the emotional mind loves the comfort of the existing routine. This tension can doom a change effort\x97but if it is overcome, change can come quickly.<br><br>In\xa0<i>Switch,</i> the Heaths show how everyday people\x97employees and managers, parents and nurses\x97have united both minds and, as a result, achieved dramatic results:\xa0\xa0<br><br>?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0The lowly medical interns who managed to defeat an entrenched, decades-old medical practice that was endangering patients.<br><br>?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0The home-organizing guru who developed a simple technique for overcoming the dread of housekeeping.<br><br>?\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0The manager who transformed a lackadaisical customer-support team into service zealots by <i>removing</i> a standard tool of customer service<br>\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0 \xa0<br>In a compelling, story-driven narrative, the Heaths bring together decades of counterintuitive research in psychology, sociology, and other fields to shed new light on how we can effect transformative change. <i>Switch\xa0</i>shows that successful changes follow a pattern, a pattern you can use to make the changes that matter to you, whether your interest is in changing the world or changing your waistline.'

p1000
S"Set in North Africa, summer 1942, during Rommel's campaign against the British. This is the story of Alex Wolff, master spy, who treks across the Sahara and covertly enters the plot-ridden streets of wartime Cairo. And of Major Vandam, the British officer who is on Wolff's trail, sworn to destroy him. Wolff's mission is to steal British military plans and send them to Rommel, using a code whose key is buried in the pages of Daphne du Maurier's novel Rebecca. As Rommel's troops come closer to victory, Vandam edges closer to Wolff and the crucial key. There are incredible chase scenes: a motorcycle hurtling through blacked-out Cairo; the flash of a knife, a gush of hot blood, and the fleeting shadow of an escaping assassin; a harrowing race against death and a speeding train. Follett builds tension and suspense to a screaming pitch as he follows the adversaries across the internal desert to a confrontation as startling as it is explosive."

S'Popular marriage counselor and seminar leader John Gray provides a unique, practical and proven way for men and women to communicate and relate better by acknowledging the differences between them. <P>Once upon a time Martians and Venusians met, fell in love, and had happy relationships together because they respected and accepted their differences. Then they came to earth and amnesia set in: they forgot they were from different planets. <P>Using this metaphor to illustrate the commonly occurring conflicts between men and women, Gray explains how these differences can come between the sexes and prohibit mutually fulfilling loving relationships. Based on years of successful counseling of couples, he gives advice on how to counteract these differences in communication styles, emotional needs and modes of behavior to promote a greater understanding between individual partners. Gray shows how men and women react differently in conversation and how their relationships are affected by male intimacy cycles ("get close", "back off"), and female self-esteem fluctuations ("I\'m okay", "I\'m not okay"). He encourages readers to accept the other gender\'s particular way of expressing love, and helps men and women learn how to fulfill each other\'s emotional needs. <P>With practical suggestions on how to reduce conflict, crucial information on how to interpret a partner\'s behavior and methods for preventing emotional "trash from the past" from invading new relationships, <I>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus </I>is a valuable tool for couples who want to develop deeper and more satisfying relationships with their partners.'

A man with a  remarkable breadth of cultural interest, with penetrating insight  into modern life, and with a clear sense of spiritual reality,  Schaeffer was also a man who cared deeply about people and their  search for truth and reality in their lives.</p>  <p>With the publication of this Trilogy, Dr. Schaeffer's three  foundational books are available for the first time in one volume.  Schaeffer himself considered these three books to be essential to  everything he wrote (twenty-three books in all), and it is here  especially that we see his ability to understand the deep need of  modern man for truth, beauty, and meaning in life.></p>  <p>In the first book,\xa0<em>The God Who Is There</em>, Schaeffer  shows how modern thought has abandoned the idea of truth with  tragic consequences in every area of culture--from philosophy, to  art, to music, to theology, and within culture as a whole.</p>  <p><em>Escape from Reason</em>, the second book, explains  especially how the disintegration of modern life and culture grows  from corrupted roots that reach far into the past.</p>  <p>In the last book,\xa0<em>He Is There and He Is Not  Silent</em>, Schaeffer contrasts the silence and despair of modern  life with the Christian answer that God can indeed be known because  He\xa0<em>is</em>\xa0there and He\xa0<em>is  not</em>\xa0silent. In addition to the convenience of having  Schaeffer's three foundational books in one volume, the Trilogy is  especially valuable in that it uses the text revised and updated by  Schaeffer shortly before his death.</p>  <p>Why was Schaeffer able to understand and communicate so  effectively to a generation? The best way to know is to find out  firsthand, by reading his essential works as found in this Trilogy.  Few who begin this journey will come to the end without having  their life profoundly changed.</p>"

With a gimlet eye and measured, often ironic, voice, Hirsi Ali recounts the evolution of her beliefs, her ironclad will, and her extraordinary resolve to fight injustice done in the name of religion. Raised in a strict Muslim family and extended clan, Hirsi Ali survived civil war, female mutilation, brutal beatings, adolescence as a devout believer during the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood, and life in four troubled, unstable countries largely ruled by despots. In her early twenties, she escaped from a forced marriage and sought asylum in the Netherlands, where she earned a college degree in political science, tried to help her tragically depressed sister adjust to the West, and fought for the rights of Muslim immigrant women and the reform of Islam as a member of Parliament. Even though she is under constant threat -- demonized by reactionary Islamists and politicians, disowned by her father, and expelled from her family and clan -- she refuses to be silenced.  <P> Ultimately a celebration of triumph over adversity, Hirsi Ali's story tells how a bright little girl evolved out of dutiful obedience to become an outspoken, pioneering freedom fighter. As Western governments struggle to balance democratic ideals with religious pressures, no story could be timelier or more significant."

S'The long-hidden story of a family we thought we knew-and of a power-making apparatus that we have barely begun to comprehend. After eight disastrous years, George W. Bush leaves office as one of the most unpopular presidents in American history. Russ Baker asks the question that lingers even as this benighted administration winds down: Who really wanted this man at the helm of the country, and why did his backers promote him despite his obvious liabilities and limitations? This book goes deep behind the scenes to deliver an arresting new look at George W. Bush, his father George H. W. Bush, their family, and the network of figures in intelligence, the military, finance, and oil who enabled the family-s rise to power. Baker-s exhaustive investigation reveals a remarkable clan whose hermetic secrecy and code of absolute loyalty have concealed a far-reaching role in recent history that transcends the Bush presidencies. Baker offers new insights into lingering mysteries-from the death of John F. Kennedy to Richard Nixon-s downfall in Watergate. Here, too, are insider accounts of the backroom strategizing, and outright deception, that resulted in George W. Bush-s electoral success. Throughout, Baker helps us understand why we have not known these things before. Family of Secrets combines compelling narrative with eye-opening revelations. It offers the untold history of the machinations that have shaped American politics over much of the last century.'

Uncanny tempests of incredible power sweep across the rocky terrain so frequently that they have shaped ecology and civilization alike. Animals hide in shells, trees pull in branches, and grass retracts into the soilless ground. Cities are built only where the topography offers shelter.<BR><BR>It has been centuries since the fall of the ten consecrated orders known as the Knights Radiant, but their Shardblades and Shardplate remain: mystical swords and suits of armor that transform ordinary men into near-invincible warriors. Men trade kingdoms for Shardblades. Wars were fought for them, and won by them.<BR><BR>One such war rages on a ruined landscape called the Shattered Plains. There, Kaladin, who traded his medical apprenticeship for a spear to protect his little brother, has been reduced to slavery. In a war that makes no sense, where ten armies fight separately against a single foe, he struggles to save his men and to fathom the leaders who consider them expendable.<BR><BR>Brightlord Dalinar Kholin commands one of those other armies. Like his brother, the late king, he is fascinated by an ancient text called <I>The Way of Kings</I>. Troubled by over-powering visions of ancient times and the Knights Radiant, he has begun to doubt his own sanity.<BR><BR>Across the ocean, an untried young woman named Shallan seeks to train under an eminent scholar and notorious heretic, Dalinar\x92s niece, Jasnah. Though she genuinely loves learning, Shallan\x92s motives are less than pure. As she plans a daring theft, her research for Jasnah hints at secrets of the Knights Radiant and the true cause of the war.<BR><BR>The result of over ten years of planning, writing, and world-building, <I>The Way of Kings</I> is but the opening movement of the Stormlight Archive, a bold masterpiece in the making.<BR><BR>Speak again the ancient oaths,<BR><BR><B>Life before death.<BR></B><B>Strength before weakness.<BR></B><B>Journey before Destination.<BR><BR></B>and return to men the Shards they once bore.<BR><BR>The Knights Radiant must stand again.</P></DIV></DIV>'

He eviscerates the major arguments for religion and demonstrates the supreme improbability of a supreme being. He shows how religion fuels war, foments bigotry, and abuses children, buttressing his points with historical and contemporary evidence. The God Delusion makes a compelling case that belief in God is not just wrong but potentially deadly. It also offers exhilarating insight into the advantages of atheism to the individual and society, not the least of which is a clearer, truer appreciation of the universe's wonders than any faith could ever muster.</div>"

S'Unfortunately, most of us have little sense of our talents and strengths, much less the ability to build our lives around them. Instead, guided by our parents, by our teachers, by our managers, and by psychology\'s fascination with pathology, we become experts in our weaknesses and spend our lives trying to repair these flaws, while our strengths lie dormant and neglected. <P> Marcus Buckingham, coauthor of the national bestseller <I>First, Break All the Rules,</I> and Donald O. Clifton, Chair of the Gallup International Research & Education Center, have created a revolutionary program to help readers identify their talents, build them into strengths, and enjoy consistent, near-perfect performance. At the heart of the book is the Internet-based StrengthsFinder\xae Profile, the product of a 25-year, multimillion-dollar effort to identify the most prevalent human strengths. The program introduces 34 dominant "themes" with thousands of possible combinations, and reveals how they can best be translated into personal and career success. In developing this program, Gallup has conducted psychological profiles with more than two million individuals to help readers learn how to focus and perfect these themes.  <P> So how does it work? This book contains a unique identification number that allows you access to the StrengthsFinder Profile on the Internet. This Web-based interview analyzes your instinctive reactions and immediately presents you with your five most powerful signature themes. Once you know which of the 34 themes -- such as Achiever, Activator, Empathy, Futuristic, or Strategic -- you lead with, the book will show you how to leverage them for powerful results at three levels: for your own development, for your success as a manager, and for the success of your organization. <P> With accessible and profound insights on how to turn talents into strengths, and with the immediate on-line feedback of StrengthsFinder at its core, <I>Now, Discover Your Strengths</I> is one of the most groundbreaking and useful business books ever written.<P><B>Please note that the code for the Online Strengths Finder Test is found on the inside of the dust jacket.</b>'

S"An intellectual dialogue of the highest plane achieved in America, the correspondence between John Adams and Thomas Jefferson spanned half a century and embraced government, philosophy, religion, quotidiana, and family griefs and joys. First meeting as delegates to the Continental Congress in 1775, they initiated correspondence in 1777, negotiated jointly as ministers in Europe in the 1780s, and served the early Republic\x97each, ultimately, in its highest office. At Jefferson's defeat of Adams for the presidency in 1800, they became estranged, and the correspondence lapses from 1801 to 1812, then is renewed until the death of both in 1826, fifty years to the day after the Declaration of Independence.<p>Lester J. Cappon's edition, first published in 1959 in two volumes, provides the complete correspondence between these two men and includes the correspondence between Abigail Adams and Jefferson. Many of these letters have been published in no other modern edition, nor does any other edition devote itself exclusively to the exchange between Jefferson and the Adamses. Introduction, headnotes, and footnotes inform the reader without interrupting the speakers.

(S'The Last Stand: Custer, Sitting Bull, and the Battle of the Little Bighorn'
p1227
S"<B>The bestselling author of <I>Mayflower</I> sheds new light on one of the iconic stories of the American West </B> <BR><BR> Little Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the Spartans' defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo. <BR><BR> In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George Armstrong Custer, one of the Union's greatest cavalry officers and a man with a reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the government's Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations. <BR><BR> Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. The Last Stand is a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that continues to haunt our collective imagination."

p1232
S'Written for ages 5 and 6, My First Piano Adventure  captures the child\'s playful spirit. Fun-filled songs, rhythm games and technique activities develop beginning keyboard skills. Three distinguishing features of the Lesson Book A make it unique and effective for the young 5-6 year old beginner. 1. A strong focus on technique embedded in the book through playful technique games, chants, and carefully-composed pieces that gently lead the child into pianistic motions. 2. An outstanding CD for the young student to listen, sing, tap, and play along with at the piano. The orchestrated songs on the CD feature children singing the lyrics, which has great appeal to the 5-6 year old beginner. The CD becomes a ready-made practice partner that guides the student and parent for all the pieces and activities in the books. 3. The fanciful art features five multi-cultural children who are also learning to play. These friends at the piano introduce basic rhythms, white key names, and a variety of white and black-key songs that span classical, folk, and blues. Young students will listen, sing, create, and play more musically with Nancy and Randall Faber s My First Piano Adventure, Lesson Book A. The Lesson Book introduces directional pre-reading, elementary music theory and technique with engaging songs, games, and creative discovery at the keyboard. Young students will enjoy the multi-cultural "friends at the piano" who introduce white-key names, basic rhythms, and a variety of songs which span classical, folk, and blues. Ear-training and eye-training are also part of the curriculum. The Fabers\' instructional theory "ACE" - Analysis, Creativity, and Expression, guides the pedagogy of My First Piano Adventure. Analysis leads to understanding, creativity leads to self-discovery, and expression develops personal artistry. The CD for this book offers a unique listening experience with outstanding orchestrations and vocals. The recordings demonstrate a key principle of the course: when children listen, sing, tap, and move to their piano music, they play more musically.'

For the farming Pye family, life is a Greek tragedy where the sins of the fathers are visited on the sons, and terrible events occur\x96offstage. <br><br>Centerstage are the Morrisons, whose tragedy looks more immediate if less brutal, but is, in reality, insidious and divisive. Orphaned young, Kate Morrison was her older brother Matt\x92s protegee, her fascination for pond life fed by his passionate interest in the natural world. Now a zoologist, she can identify organisms under a microscope but seems blind to the state of her own emotional life. And she thinks she\x92s outgrown her siblings\x96Luke, Matt, and Bo\x96who were once her entire world. <br><br>In this universal drama of family love and misunderstandings, of resentments harbored and driven underground, Lawson ratchets up the tension with heartbreaking humor and consummate control, continually overturning one\x92s expectations right to the very end.

p1257
S"To Laius, King of Thebes, an oracle foretold that the child born to him by his queen Jocasta would slay his father and wed his mother. So when in time a son was born the infant's feet were riveted together and he was left to die on Mount Cithaeron. But a shepherd found the babe and tended him, and delivered him to another shepherd who took him to his master, the King of Corinth. Polybus being childless adopted the boy, who grew up believing that he was indeed the King's son. Afterwards doubting his parentage he inquired of the Delphic god and heard himself the word declared before to Laius. Wherefore he fled from what he deemed his father's house and in his flight he encountered and unwillingly slew his father Laius. Arriving at Thebes he answered the riddle of the Sphinx and the grateful Thebans made their deliverer king. So he reigned in the room of Laius, and espoused the widowed queen. Children were born to them and Thebes prospered under his rule, but again a grievous plague fell upon the city. Again the oracle was consulted and it bade them purge themselves of blood-guiltiness. Oedipus denounces the crime of which he is unaware, and undertakes to track out the criminal. Step by step it is brought home to him that he is the man. The closing scene reveals Jocasta slain by her own hand and Oedipus blinded by his own act and praying for death or exile."

Combining two distinct yet interwoven parts-one set in ancient Jerusalem, one in contemporary Moscow-the novel veers from moods of wild theatricality with violent storms, vampire attacks, and a Satanic ball; to such somber scenes as the meeting of Pilate and Yeshua, and the murder of Judas in the moonlit garden of Gethsemane; to the substanceless, circus-like reality of Moscow. Its central characters, Woland (Satan) and his retinue-including the vodka-drinking, black cat, Behemoth; the poet, Ivan Homeless; Pontius Pilate; and a writer known only as The Master, and his passionate companion, Margarita-exist in a world that blends fantasy and chilling realism, an artful collage of grostesqueries, dark comedy, and timeless ethical questions.<br><br> Although completed in 1940, <i>The Master and Margarita</i> was not published in Moscow until 1966, when the first part appeared in the magazine <i>Moskva</i>.

S'<b>A brand-new book of hilarious and insightful personal essays by the iconic, irresistible Sloane Crosley. </B> <BR><BR> From the author of the sensational bestseller <I>I Was Told There\'d Be Cake</I> comes a new book of personal essays brimming with all the charm and wit that have earned Sloane Crosley widespread acclaim, award nominations, and an ever-growing cadre of loyal fans. In <I>Cake</I> readers were introduced to the foibles of Crosley\'s life in New York City-always teetering between the glamour of Manhattan parties, the indignity of entry-level work, and the special joy of suburban nostalgia-and to a literary voice that mixed Dorothy Parker with David Sedaris and became something all its own. <BR><BR> Crosley still lives and works in New York City, but she\'s no longer the newcomer for whom a trip beyond the Upper West Side is a big adventure. She can pack up her sensibility and takes us with her to Paris, to Portugal (having picked it by spinning a globe and putting down her finger, and finally falling in with a group of Portuguese clowns), and even to Alaska, where the "bear bells" on her fellow bridesmaids\' ponytails seemed silly until a grizzly cub dramatically intrudes. Meanwhile, back in New York, where new apartments beckon and taxi rides go awry, her sense of the city has become more layered, her relationships with friends and family more complicated. <BR><BR> As always, Crosley\'s voice is fueled by the perfect witticism, buoyant optimism, flair for drama, and easy charm in the face of minor suffering or potential drudgery. But in <I>How Did You Get This Number</I> it has also become increasingly sophisticated, quicker and sharper to the point, more complex and lasting in the emotions it explores. And yet, Crosley remains the unfailingly hilarious young Everywoman, healthily equipped with intelligence and poise to fend off any potential mundanity in maturity.'

You have caller ID; who else would I be?"<br><br>There were tears in Charlee\'s voice. "Oh my god, you\'re alive. Paul said you\'d been killed. When we tried to get more information out of him, he said it was a werewolf. Where are you?"<br><br>Jane\'s stomach roiled at Paul\'s lie, but she chose not to address it. Getting to safety was the priority. Her eyes roved over the walls of the office, looking for anything that might give her a clue to her location to help them start a search. <br><br>"I don\'t know. I\'m in their den I think. Cole has me."<br><br>"Cole? Jane, you\'ve got to get out of there."<br><br>She gritted her teeth. "No, I thought it would be fun to hang out a while. If there was a way out, I would have taken it. I . . ."<br><br>The phone was pulled out of her hand. She spun to see Cole pressing the "end" button. He was standing in a towel, dripping from the shower. Her tongue darted out to wet her suddenly dry lips. <br><br>"No phone."<br><br>She moved behind the desk to put something between them. Not that a puny little desk was going to stand in his way if he was going to go psycho over her trying to call for help. Before she could think of anything placating to say, the phone rang again. He answered it.<br><br>"Hello . . . Yes, this is Cole Riley . . . Yes, I have Jane . . . No, I won\'t release her to you . . . the debt is ten thousand dollars . . . Oh, you think you can get Anthony to give you the money? Does Anthony have limitless supplies of cash to cover the gambling debts of his fledge? Let me talk to him."<br><br>Cole\'s back was to her as he spoke. Jane sank into the chair and watched the water droplets trail their way down his skin, trying to convince herself it would be fine.<br><br><br>*If you like Zoe Winters, you may also like Kait Nolan and H.P.

His new revision and expansion of thesubject comes after much further research and practical experience.  Dr. VasantLad points out: "The healing science of Ayurveda is based totally upon theknowledge of "prakriti", the individual constitution.  If every individual knows his own constitution, then one can understand, for instance, what is a good diet and style of life for oneself.  One man\'s food is another man\'s poison.Therefore, to make one\'s life healthy, happy and balanced, the knowledge ofconstitution is absolutely necessary."

This suffering emerges in crippling self-judgments and conflicts in our relationships, in addictions and perfectionism, in loneliness and overwork--all the forces that keep our lives constricted and unfulfilled. Radical Acceptance offers a path to freedom, including the day-to-day practical guidance developed over Dr. Brach\x92s twenty years of work with therapy clients and Buddhist students.<br><br>Writing with great warmth and clarity, Tara Brach brings her teachings alive through personal stories and case histories, fresh interpretations of Buddhist tales, and guided meditations.

Contrary to those scholars who claim that Madison dispensed with the need to form an active and virtuous citizenry, Sheehan argues that Madison\'s vision for the new nation was informed by the idea of republican self-government, whose manifestation he sought to bring about in the spirit and way of life of the American people.

(S"The German Genius: Europe's Third Renaissance, the Second Scientific Revolution, and the Twentieth Century"
p1439
S"<p>Peter Watson's virtuoso sweep through modern German thought and culture, from 1750 to the present day, will challenge and confound both the stereotypes the world has of Germany and those that Germany has of itself.</p><p>From the end of the Baroque era and the death of Bach to the rise of Hitler in 1933, Germany was transformed from a poor relation among Western nations into a dominant intellectual and cultural force\x97more creative and influential than France, Britain, Italy, Holland, and the United States. In the early decades of the twentieth century, German artists, writers, scholars, philosophers, scientists, and engineers were leading their freshly unified country to new and unimagined heights. By 1933, Germans had won more Nobel Prizes than any other nationals, and more than the British and Americans combined. Yet this remarkable genius was cut down in its prime by Adolf Hitler and his disastrous Third Reich\x97a brutal legacy that has overshadowed the nation's achievements ever since.</p><p>How did the Germans transform their country so as to achieve such pre-eminence? In this absorbing cultural and intellectual history, Peter Watson goes back through time to explore the origins of the Germangenius, and he explains how and why it flourished, how it shaped our lives, and, most important, how it continues to influence our world. As he convincingly demonstrates, it was German thinking\x97from Beethoven and Kant to Diesel and Nietzsche, from Goethe and Wagner to Mendel and Planck, from Hegel and Marx to Freud and Schoenberg\x97that was paramount in the creation of the modern West. Moreover, despite World War II, figures such as Joseph Beuys, J\xdcrgen Habermas, and Joseph Ratzinger ensure that the German genius still resonates intellectually today.</p>"

S'How are we doing? The church, that is. Congregations have long measured success by -bodies, budget, and buildings--a certain record of attendance, the offering plate, and square footage. But the scorecard can-t stop there. When it does, a deeper emphasis on accountability, discipleship, and spiritual maturity is lost. Ignoring those details, we see fewer lives transformed, Christian influence wane, and churches thin out-a situation that is all too familiar across North America today. It is time to take heart and rework the scorecard.  According to Ed Stetzer and Thom S. Rainer, the authors of Transformational  Church, -Too often we-ve highlighted the negative realities of the declining  American church but missed the opportunity to magnify the God of hope and  transformation.-  Based on the most comprehensive study of its kind, including a survey of  more than 7,000 churches and hundreds of on-site interviews with pastors,  Transformational Church takes us to the thriving congregations where truly  changing lives is the norm.  Stetzer and Rainer clearly confirm the importance of disciple making for all  through active biblical engagement and prayerful dependence on God alongside of ever-increasing, intentional participation in mission and ministry activities. As the church engages these issues, the world will see the change: more people following Christ, more believers growing in their faith, and more churches making an impact on their communities.'

S'<blockquote> <p> No secret is too dark. <br> No revelation too sick. But you must have the appetite for it. </p> </blockquote> <p> After forty years, twenty-eight ODs, three botched suicides, two heart attacks, a couple of jail stints, and a debilitating stroke, Steven Adler, the most self-destructive rock star ever, is ready to share the shattering untold truth in <i>My Appetite for Destruction</i>. </p> <p> When Adler was eleven years old he told his two closest friends he was going to be a rock star in the world\'s greatest band. Along with four uniquely talented\x97but very complicated and demanding\x97musicians, Adler helped form Guns N\' Roses. They rose from the streets\x97primal rockers who obliterated glam rock and its big hair to resurrect rock\'s truer blues roots. </p> <p> They were relentless rock stars, onstage and off, taking "sex, drugs, and rock \'n\' roll" to obscene levels of reckless abandon. By the late 1980s, GNR was the biggest rock band in the world, demanding headlines, awards, and sold-out shows, with one of the greatest rock albums of all time: <i>Appetite for Destruction</i>. But there was a price to pay. For Adler, it was his health and his sanity, culminating in a brutal banishment by his once-beloved musical brothers. Adler digs deep, revealing the last secrets, not only his own but GNR\'s as well: Slash\'s betrayal, Axl\'s unpredictable temper, and Duff\'s revenge. He bares it all with this shocking fuck-the-fates expos\xc9 that charts his meteoric rise and devastating collapse. </p> <p> Adler was humiliated and disgraced when Axl Rose kicked him out of GNR in front of an MTV audience of millions. Adler plunged into the dark side, spending most of the next twenty years in a drug-fueled hell. But he finally beat his epic addiction to crack and heroin under the care of Dr. Drew Pinsky. </p> <p> With Adler\'s newfound clarity comes a fierce determination to tell it all. Revelatory, heartbreaking, hilarious, and ultimately inspirational, you will never read anything more jaw-droppingly honest than <i>My Appetite for Destruction</i>. </p>'

S'The False Messiah is the first volume in the series, ZIONISM: THE REAL ENEMY OF THE JEWS, an epic journey through the propaganda lies and documented truth of history by a seasoned reporter who interviewed and was in the good graces of the major players on all sides. Alan Hart has given an honest expression of the needs, motives and dilemmas faced by all parties. He offers many unique insights into the formative events in this region and the evolution of relations within and between the Israeli, Arab, US, UK and European leadership. This is the first book to put the struggle for Palestine into its global context--to show how all the pieces of a complicated jig-saw puzzle fit together. It\'s also the first ever account of events to address the motives, needs, and dilemmas faced by all sides: diaspora Jews\' real fear of Holocaust II; the Palestinian right to justice and self-determination; the legitimate anger of the Arab masses at American support for Zionism right or wrong; and the inevitable corruption and repression of the regimes of the existing Arab Order who, fearing harsher Israeli assaults, have tried to contain them.<br><br>"Hart s readable account of history, his obviously erudite analysis and his ability in bringing the factual conflict to life on the page ensures the reader\'s interest is unwavering throughout. His passion and empathy with both sides is apparent. For the Jews, the unspeakable fear of another Holocaust due to Zionist manipulation and tyranny; and for the Arabs and Muslims, the anger and humiliation they are feeling every day that Palestine is being torn apart." -- Samira Quraishy, researcher, Islamic Human Rights Commission<br><br>"Hart\'s book is a good act, a brave act for someone from British state media. He says he has to live with himself, and it is obvious this book comes from a place of integrity. Volume One: The False Messiah augurs well for the rest of the series." -- KIM PETERSEN, Dissident Voice<br><br>"These two volumes are a vital exposition of Zionist history and its interface with diplomacy and the Israel-Arab conflict, up until the assassination of President Kennedy. Alan Hart promises another volume, perhaps two, and one looks forward to their publication.... an essential understanding of what happened in the struggle for Israel-Palestine and of the role of Zionism in this sad story." -- REUEL AMDUR, The Canadian Charger, January 27, 2010'

p1558
S'It was the mystery that gripped the nation during the summer of 2001: the sudden disappearance of Chandra Levy, a young, promising intern, and the possible involvement of Congressman Gary Condit. And then the case went cold. By 2007, satellite trucks and reporters had long since abandoned the story of the congressman and the intern in search of other news, fresh scandals. Across the country, Chandra\x92s parents tried to resume their daily lives, desperately hoping that someday there might be a break in the investigation.<P>And in Washington, the old game of who\x92s up and who\x92s down played on without interruption. <P>But Chandra Levy haunted. Six years after the young intern\x92s disappearance, investigative editors of the <I>Washington Post </I>pitched two Pulitzer Prize\x96 winning reporters their idea: Revisit the unsolved case and\xa0find out what happened to Chandra, a task that had eluded police and the FBI. <P>Scott Higham and Sari Horwitz went to work. e result was a thirteen-part series in the <I>Washington Post </I>that focused on a prime suspect the police and the FBI had passed over years before. They had wrongly pursued Condit and chased numerous false leads, including a claim that Chandra had been kidnapped and taken to the Middle East. <P>But the most likely culprit was far less glamorous: an immigrant from El Salvador, a young man in the clutches of alcohol, drugs, and violence who had been stalking the running paths of Rock Creek Park, assaulting female joggers at knifepoint. He had attacked again, even as the police and the press concentrated on a congressman romantically linked to the intern. <I></I><P><I>Finding Chandra </I>explores the bungled police efforts to locate the crime scene and catch a killer, the ambition and hubris of Washington\x92s power elite and press corps, the twisted culture of politics, the dark nature of political scandal, and the agony of parents struggling to comprehend the loss of a child. Above all, it is a quintessential portrait of a cast of outsiders who came to Washington with dreams of something better, only to be forever changed.'

S"The fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style is the most extensive revision in twenty years. The Manual--more comprehensive and easier to use than ever before--remains the essential reference for authors, editors, proofreaders, indexers, copywriters, designers, and publishers in any field.     <P>Those who work with words know how dramatically publishing has changed in the past decade, with technology now informing and influencing every stage of the writing and publishing process. In creating the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style, the renowned editorial staff of the University of Chicago Press drew on direct experience of these changes, as well as on the recommendations of the Manual's first-ever advisory board, composed of a distinguished group of scholars, authors, and professionals from a wide range of publishing and business environments.    <P>Every aspect of coverage has been examined and brought up to date--from publishing formats to editorial style and method, from documentation of electronic sources to book design and production, and everything in between. In addition to books, The Chicago Manual of Style now also treats journals and electronic publications. All chapters are written for the electronic age, with advice on how to prepare and edit manuscripts online, handle copyright and permissions issues raised by new technologies, use the latest methods of preparing mathematical copy, and cite electronic and online sources.    <P>A new chapter covers American English grammar and usage, outlining the grammatical structure of English, showing how to put words and phrases together to achieve clarity, and identifying common errors. The two chapters on documentation have been reorganized and updated: the first now describes the two main systems preferred by Chicago, and the second discusses specific types of sources and subject matter, with examples tailored to both systems. Coverage of design and manufacturing has been streamlined to reflect what writers and editors need to know about current procedures. And, to make it easier to search for information, each numbered paragraph throughout the Manual is now introduced by a descriptive heading.    <P>What would become The Chicago Manual of Style began in the 1890s as a single sheet of typographic fundamentals, prepared by a proofreader at the University of Chicago Press as a guide for the University community. That sheet grew into a pamphlet, and the pamphlet grew into a book--the first edition of the Manual of Style, published in 1906. Nearly a century later the Manual is in use in homes and offices around the world.    <P>Clear, concise, and replete with commonsense advice, the fifteenth edition of The Chicago Manual of Style offers the wisdom of a hundred years of editorial practice while including a wealth of new topics and updated perspectives. For anyone who works with words, in any medium, this continues to be the one reference book you simply must have.      <P>What\x92s New in the Fifteenth Edition of The Chicago Manual of Style:    <P>* Updated material throughout to reflect current style, technology, and professional practice     <P>* New coverage of journals and electronic publications     <P>* Comprehensive new chapter on American English grammar and usage by Bryan A. Garner (author of A Dictionary of Modern American Usage)     <P>* Updated and rewritten chapter on preparing mathematical copy     <P>* Reorganized and updated chapters on documentation, including guidance on citing electronic sources     <P>* Streamlined coverage of current design and production processes, with a glossary of key terms     <P>* New diagrams of the editing and production processes for both books and journals, keyed to chapter discussions     <P>* Descriptive headings on all numbered paragraphs for ease of reference     <P>* Companion website at Chicagomanualofstyle.org"

A real historical figure, Elizabeth married into the family of Governor John Winthrop of the Massachusetts Bay Colony.

p1662
S'At the Altar of Sexual Idolatry is a thorough and  penetrating examination of sexual addiction. It draws back the curtain  and exposes the inner workings of sexual sin in the heart, which the  author understands, having lived in the bondage of it himself for over  twelve years. He is not presenting theories or opinions, but the  biblical answers that have worked in his own life and in the lives of  hundreds of men he has personally discipled since 1986.    <P>At the Altar of Sexual Idolatry does not contain the worn out  explanations, humanistic solutions, or superficial answers that have  been prevelant during the last decade. Sexual addiction is a spiritual  problem that requires solutions with spiritual depth. What is  presented in this book is firmly rooted in Scripture and always points  the man to Jesus Christ as the ultimate answer to his problem.'

S'CAN I GET A \x93RAMEN\x94 FROM THE CONGREGATION?!<br><br>Behold the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster (FSM), today\x92s fastest growing carbohydrate-based religion. According to church founder Bobby Henderson, the universe and all life within it were created by a mystical and divine being: the Flying Spaghetti Monster. What drives the FSM\x92s devout followers, a.k.a. Pastafarians? Some say it\x92s the assuring touch from the FSM\x92s \x93noodly appendage.\x94 Then there are those who love the worship service, which is conducted in pirate talk and attended by congregants in dashing buccaneer garb. Still others are drawn to the Church\x92s flimsy moral standards, religious holidays every Friday, or the fact that Pastafarian heaven is way cooler: Does your heaven have a Stripper Factory and a Beer Volcano? Intelligent Design has finally met its match\x96and it has nothing to do with apes or the Olive Garden of Eden.<br><br>Within these pages, Bobby Henderson outlines the true facts\x96 dispelling such malicious myths as evolution (\x93only a theory\x94), science (\x93only a lot of theories\x94), and whether we\x92re really descended from apes (fact: Humans share 95 percent of their DNA with chimpanzees, but they share 99.9 percent with pirates!)<br>See what impressively credentialed top scientists have to say:<br><br><i>\x93If Intelligent Design is taught in schools, equal time should be given to the FSM theory and the non-FSM theory.\x94</i><br>\x96Professor Douglas Shaw, Ph.D.<br> <br><i>\x93Do not be hypocritical.

(S'Official Book Club Selection: A Memoir According to Kathy Griffin'
p1682
S'<b>A Conversation with Kathy Griffin:<br><br>Q: State your name and profession.<br></b>KG: My name is Kathy Griffin, and I am a teller of d**k jokes. And a plumber.<br><br><b>Q: This is your first book. Had you ever considered writing anything before? A novel? Or a work of historical scholarship? Or a children\'s story?<br></b>KG: I had not considered it, because I\'d always been told by the nuns at St. Bernadine\'s that my cursive was poor. A children\' s story is an interesting idea. How\'s this for a title: "Waterboarding Pre-Teens: The Debate is Back On." I have a political side as well.<br><br><b>Q: You seem fairly obsessed with Oprah. Is this something you\'ll ever outgrow?<br></b>KG: I will never outgrow my obsession with Oprah. Just as she will never outgrow her cardigan sweaters. Oops, she already has. Now look, that sounds like a dig, but it\'s not. It\'s called a struggle, and I\'m on it with her. I support her. (Not as much as she needs those underwire bras to support her, because she\'s got some serious ropes and pulleys going on there.) The point is, I worship her, and fear her at the same time. And believe me, that\' s how she wants it. Don\'t be fooled.<br><br><b>Q: Did I miss something? Where\'s Celine Dion in this book?<br></b>KG: I didn\'t write about Celine Dion, only because of my fear of her husband Rene Angelil. I have an unfounded but constant fear that he could be in the French-Canadian mafia. Or have French-Canadian mafia ties, and by ties I don\'t mean les cravats. And I fear that I may be abducted, whisked away and held prisoner at a charming little brasserie in Montreal, forced to eat multiple Croque Monsieur sandwiches until I confess to knowing the lyrics to every single one of her songs.<br><br><b>Q: What do you think gays should take away from reading this book?<br></b>KG: I think the gays should be happy with this book. It talks a lot about being who you are, and I certainly mention a lot of gay people. I would say it definitely has strong gay themes, and the gay community should know that frankly it has been a moral struggle for me to even acknowledge the heterosexual community in this book at all. But I am slowly reaching out an olive branch to the heterosexual community, even though I believe everything they do goes against the teachings of Our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. But I\'m trying not to judge them.<br><br><b>Q: Describe your ideal, make-a-wish day of personal experiences with bats**t celebrities.<br></b>KG: Well, it would start with some sort of a fit in the hair-and-makeup trailer on a set. I heard a story that when Sharon Stone was working on "Casino," she got into such a fight with her hairdresser, that after he spent four hours doing this beautiful bouffant hairdo for her, she got up and walked in the sink and put her head underwater. I have no idea if that\'s true, but I hope it is, cause that\'s some awesome s**t I would love to see. Then it would go right to lunch, where I could witness an eating disorder. Maybe a Lohan is purging in a bush somewhere with her finger down her throat. Or perhaps there\'s an Olsen twin on a scale crying because she finally tipped 100. Any outburst over weight I would cherish. Also, it would be great to see an actress have a workload meltdown. So maybe at 2:00 some A-lister saying, "I can\'t handle this s**t anymore." Because I love when actors can\'t deal with a normal workday, and they think two in the afternoon is like midnight, so I would love to see somebody storming to their car, exhausted because they\'ve put in a grueling four-hour workday of saying three lines and texting their nanny. Then it\'s maybe off to an illicit affair. At the top of my wish list would be following a rapper or a football player over to his baby mama\'s house where a screaming match ensues to the point where someone, maybe me, has to anonymously dial 911, and then I take a couple pictures, and I become an unannounced star witness later at the trial, entering Joan Collins-style in a smashing hat. And then at the end of the day it\'s a healthy round of clubbing with Janice Dickinson, and then on the way home we go to the Beverly Glen pharmacy and run into Paula Abdul. All three of us secretly take our small white-paper pharmacy bags and put them behind our backs and make uncomfortable small talk.<br><br><br><b>Official Book Club Selection</b> is Kathy Griffin unplugged, uncensored, and unafraid to dish about what really happens on the road, away from the cameras, and at the star party after the show. (It\'s also her big chance to score that coveted book club endorsement she\'s always wanted. Are you there, Oprah? It\'s me, Kathy.)<br><br>Kathy Griffin has won Emmys for her reality show Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List, been nominated for a Grammy, worked and walked every red carpet known to man, and rung in the New Year with Anderson Cooper. But the legions of fans who pack Kathy\'s sold-out comedy shows have heard only part of her remarkable story. Writing with her trademark wit, the feisty comic settles a few old scores, celebrates the friends and mentors who helped her claw her way to the top, and shares insider gossip about celebrity behavior\x96the good, the bad, and the very ugly. She recounts the crazy ups and downs of her own career and introduces us to some of the supertalented people she encountered before they got famous (or, in some cases, after fame went to their heads). Word to the wise: If you\'ve ever crossed Kathy Griffin at some point in your life, check the index for your name.<br><br>Along the way, Kathy reveals intimate details about her life before and after she made the big time. She opens up about everything from growing up with a dysfunctional family in suburban Illinois to bombing as a young comedian in L.A., from her well-publicized plastic surgery disasters to her highly publicized divorce, and more. Only in this book will you learn how the dinner table is the best training ground for a career in stand-up, how speaking your mind can bite you on the ass and buy you a house, and which people in Kathy\'s life have taught her the most valuable lessons\x96both inside and outside the entertainment industry. And as if all that wasn\'t enough, there are also dozens of exclusive and somewhat embarrassing photos from Kathy\'s own collection\x96featuring the diva of the D List herself, with her old nose as well as her new one, plus celebrity friends, foes, frenemies, and hangers-on for you to gawk at.<br><br>Refreshingly candid, unflinchingly honest, and full of hilarious "Did she really say that?" moments, <b>Official Book Club Selection</b> will make you laugh until you cry, or just puke up a little bit.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S'<blockquote><p>America\'s economy is in shambles. . . . <br>Its citizens are terrified and dissatisfied. . . .<br>Could it all have been planned by a secret elite one hundred years ago?</p></blockquote><p>The New World Order. Hitler referred to it in his diaries. President George H. W. Bush foretold of it in his speeches. Formed by a secretive global elite, the group seeking this new order has taken hold of the nation\x97and perhaps the world. Its influence pervades every reach of American society, from the products we buy at the grocery store to the topics of evening news programs.</p><p>But could it also be true that the New World Order caused one of the greatest financial catastrophes of our time?</p><p>For years, bestselling author and legendary conspiracy researcher Jim Marrs has exposed information that the mainstream corporate media has refused to report. Now, with a crisis upon us, Marrs has yet again unearthed the lies to expose the insidious alliances that make up a secret world.</p><p>Consider this: In 1910, a handful of the world\'s most powerful government and corporate men gathered on Jekyll Island to discuss matters at a private hunting lodge. The agenda? First, the overthrow of the sitting American president; second, the creation of a central bank, one headed by a succession of elitists who would unconstitutionally control America\'s money and its economy for decades. . . .</p><p>Flash forward one hundred years. Never before have the American people been so unhappy. Apathy and paralysis are the nation\'s guiding principles. Public education has repeatedly failed. More and more Americans rely on overpriced pills for remedies to fabricated illnesses. The average American household spends eight hours a day in front of the television, ruled by the vague fears of terrorist attacks and economic collapse. Control of the mass media has devolved to a mere five multinational corporations.</p><p><i>Throughout The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy</i>, Marrs investigates the erosion of America\'s civil liberties and the nation\'s transformation into a police state: Will the government use a microchip to monitor the populace? How does the Patriot Act relate to Nazi legislation? Have Americans today become merely a poor imitation of the robust citizenry of our nation\'s past?</p><p>Jim Marrs responds with a resounding call of "<i>Yes, we have!</i>" He also raises powerful questions about so many other things:</p><ul><li>Was the financial bailout of 2008 nothing but one group of global elites passing money to another?</li><li>Could the swine flu epidemic have been corporately manufactured?</li><li>Is Big Pharm behind a lie that claims bipolar disorder is a real illness?</li><li>Has a Nazi bioweapon caused recent maladies such as fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome?</li><li>Why did the government suppress a device that can apparently cure cancer?</li></ul><p>In the explosive <i>The Trillion-Dollar Conspiracy</i>, Marrs explores the back rooms and shadowy deals of our nation\'s past to craft a frightening history that no one else is brave enough to tell. </p>'

In a land where summers can last decades and winters a lifetime, trouble is brewing. The cold is returning, and in the frozen wastes to the north of Winterfell, sinister and supernatural forces are massing beyond the kingdom\x92s protective Wall. At the center of the conflict lie the Starks of Winterfell, a family as harsh and unyielding as the land they were born to. Sweeping from a land of brutal cold to a distant summertime kingdom of epicurean plenty, here is a tale of lords and ladies, soldiers and sorcerers, assassins and bastards, who come together in a time of grim omens.<br><br>Here an enigmatic band of warriors bear swords of no human metal; a tribe of fierce wildlings carry men off into madness; a cruel young dragon prince barters his sister to win back his throne; and a determined woman undertakes the most treacherous of journeys. Amid plots and counterplots, tragedy and betrayal, victory and terror, the fate of the Starks, their allies, and their enemies hangs perilously in the balance, as each endeavors to win that deadliest of conflicts: the game of thrones.'

S'The aim of this book is to explain, carefully but not technically, the differences between advanced, research-level mathematics, and the sort of mathematics we learn at school. The most fundamental differences are philosophical, and readers of this book will emerge with a clearer understanding of paradoxical-sounding concepts such as infinity, curved space, and imaginary numbers. The first few chapters are about general aspects of mathematical thought. These are followed by discussions of more specific topics, and the book closes with a chapter answering common sociological questions about the mathematical community (such as "Is it true that mathematicians burn out at the age of 25?") It is the ideal introduction for anyone who wishes to deepen their understanding of mathematics.'

(S'The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks'
p2071
S'Her name was Henrietta Lacks, but scientists know her as HeLa. She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells\x97taken without her knowledge\x97became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \x93immortal\x94 human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\x92d weigh more than 50 million metric tons\x97as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\x92s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions. <br><br>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.<br><br>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \x93colored\x94 ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\x92s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia\x97a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo\x97to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells. <br><br>Henrietta\x92s family did not learn of her \x93immortality\x94 until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent. And though the cells had launched a multimillion-dollar industry that sells human biological materials, her family never saw any of the profits. As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family\x97past and present\x97is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of. <br><br>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\x97especially Henrietta\x92s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\x92s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space? What happened to her sister, Elsie, who died in a mental institution at the age of fifteen? And if her mother was so important to medicine, why couldn\x92t her children afford health insurance?\xa0<br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0<br>Intimate in feeling, astonishing in scope, and impossible to put down, <i>The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks</i> captures the beauty and drama of scientific discovery, as well as its human consequences.'

S'An eye-opening and previously untold story, <i>Factory Girls</i> is the first look into the everyday lives of the migrant factory population in China.<br><br><br>China has 130 million migrant workers\x97the largest migration in human history. In <i>Factory Girls</i>, Leslie T. Chang, a former correspondent for the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> in Beijing, tells the story of these workers primarily through the lives of two young women, whom she follows over the course of three years as they attempt to rise from the assembly lines of Dongguan, an industrial city in China\x92s Pearl River Delta.<br><br>As she tracks their lives, Chang paints a never-before-seen picture of migrant life\x97a world where nearly everyone is under thirty; where you can lose your boyfriend and your friends with the loss of a mobile phone; where a few computer or English lessons can catapult you into a completely different social class. Chang takes us inside a sneaker factory so large that it has its own hospital, movie theater, and fire department; to posh karaoke bars that are fronts for prostitution; to makeshift English classes where students shave their heads in monklike devotion and sit day after day in front of machines watching English words flash by; and back to a farming village for the Chinese New Year, revealing the poverty and idleness of rural life that drive young girls to leave home in the first place. Throughout this riveting portrait, Chang also interweaves the story of her own family\x92s migrations, within China and to the West, providing historical and personal frames of reference for her investigation.<br><br>A book of global significance that provides new insight into China, <i>Factory Girls</i> demonstrates how<i> </i>the mass movement from rural villages to cities is remaking individual lives and transforming Chinese society, much as immigration to America\x92s shores remade our own country a century ago.'

Despite his good fortune, Pip is haunted by figures from his past--the escaped convict Magwitch, the time-withered Miss Havisham, and her proud and beautiful ward, Estella--and in time uncovers not just the origins of his great expectations but the mystery of his own heart. A powerful and moving novel, <em>Great Expectations</em> is suffused with Dickens\'s memories of the past and its grip on the present, and it raises disturbing questions about the extent to which individuals affect each other\'s lives. This edition reprints the definitive Clarendon text.

p2161
S'<i>The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat</i> brings together twenty-four of Oliver Sacks\'s most fascinating and iconic case studies.  The patients in these pages are confronted with almost inconceivably strange neurological disorders; in Sacks\'s retelling, their stories are a profound testament to the adaptability of the human brain and the resilience of the human spirit.      Dr. Sacks treats each of his subjects with a deep appreciation and compassion for the unique individual living beneath the disorder.  His tales inspire awe and empathy, allowing the reader to enter the uncanny worlds of those with autism, Alzheimer\'s, Tourette\'s syndrome, amnesia, and other unfathomable neurological conditions.  "One of the great clinical writers of the 20th century" (<i>The New York Times</i>), Dr. Sacks brings to vivid life some of the most fundamental questions about identity and the human mind.'

p2181
S'  Alexis de Tocqueville, a young aristocratic French lawyer, came to the United States in 1831 to study its penitentiary systems. His nine-month visit and subsequent reading and reflection resulted in <I>Democracy in America</I> (1835\x9640), a landmark masterpiece of political observation and analysis. Tocqueville vividly describes the unprecedented social equality he found in America and explores its implications for European society in the emerging modern era. His book provides enduring insight into the political consequences of widespread property ownership, the potential dangers to liberty inherent in majority rule, the importance of civil institutions in an individualistic culture dominated by the pursuit of material self-interest, and the vital role of religion in American life, while prophetically probing the deep differences between the free and slave states. The clear, fluid, and vigorous translation by Arthur Goldhammer is the first to fully capture Tocqueville\x92s achievements both as an accomplished literary stylist and as a profound political thinker.'

S'<blockquote><p>The definitive story of Hollywood\'s most famous couple</p></blockquote><p>He was a tough-guy Welshman softened by the affections of a breathtakingly beautiful woman; she was a modern-day Cleopatra madly in love with her own Mark Antony. For nearly a quarter of a century, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton were Hollywood royalty, and their fiery romance\x97often called "the marriage of the century"\x97was the most notorious, publicized, and celebrated love affair of its day.</p><p>For the first time, <i>Vanity Fair</i> contributing editor Sam Kashner and acclaimed biographer Nancy Schoenberger tell the complete story of this larger-than-life couple, showing how their romance and two marriages commanded the attention of the world. Also for the first time, in exclusive access given to the authors, Elizabeth Taylor herself gives never-revealed details and firsthand accounts of her life with Burton. </p><p>Drawing upon brand-new information and interviews\x97and on Burton\'s private, passionate, and heartbreaking letters to Taylor\x97<i>Furious Love</i> sheds new light on the movies, the sex, the scandal, the fame, the brawls, the booze, the bitter separations, and, of course, the fabled jewels. It offers an intimate glimpse into Elizabeth and Richard\'s privileged world and their elite circle of friends, among them Princess Grace, Montgomery Clift, the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, Peter O\'Toole, Michael Caine, Marlon Brando, Rex Harrison, Mike Nichols, Laurence Olivier, Robert Kennedy, Tennessee Williams, No\xcbl Coward, John Huston, Ava Gardner, the Rothschilds, Maria Callas, and Aristotle Onassis. It provides an entertaining, eye-opening look at their films, their wildly lucrative reign in Europe and in Hollywood\x97and the price they paid for their extravagant lives.</p><p>Shocking and unsparing in its honesty, <i>Furious Love</i> explores the very public marriage of "Liz and Dick" as well as the private struggles of Elizabeth and Richard, including <i>Le Scandale</i>, their affair on the set of the notorious epic <i>Cleopatra</i> that earned them condemnation from the Vatican; Burton\'s hardscrabble youth in Wales; the crippling alcoholism that nearly destroyed his career and contributed to his early death; the medical issues that plagued both him and Elizabeth; and the failed aspirations and shame that haunted him throughout their relationship. As Kashner and Schoenberger illuminate the events and choices that shaped this illustrious couple\'s story, they demonstrate how the legendary pair presaged America\'s changing attitudes toward sex, marriage, morality, and celebrity. Yet ultimately, as the authors show, Elizabeth and Richard shared something priceless beyond the drama: enduring love.</p><p>Addictive and entertaining, <i>Furious Love</i> is more than a celebrity biography; it\'s an honest yet sympathetic portrait of a man, a woman, and a passion that shocked and mesmerized the world.</p>'

(S'Rage: A Step-by-step Guide to Overcoming Explosive Anger'
p2276
S'Powerful Tools for Overcoming Extreme Anger    <P>Do you or someone you care about experience episodes of extreme and   unpredictable anger? Intense rages that threaten relationships, jobs,   property--or worse? The first thing you need to know is that you are not   alone. Researchers estimate that some 7 percent of Americans may at some   time experience a condition called intermittent explosive disorder (IED),   which is characterized by reoccuring periods of extraordinary anger, and   millions more have less frequent yet equally damaging experiences with   rage. The second thing you need to know is that there is help.     <P>Rage can be calmed and controlled with good advice and a practical,   effective plan for change. From renowned anger expert Ronald Potter-Efron,   this book breaks down rage into four types: In survival rage, anger is   triggered by a sense of danger or threat; feelings of helplessness can   trigger impotence rage; the third type, abandonment rage, is triggered by a   fear of losing a cherished relationship; and shame rage occurs when someone   feels very disrespected. Rage briefly discusses how the brain functions   during extreme emotion, and then it turns to the task of helping you stop   episodes of rage--right now! In classic Potter-Efron style, the book places   the responsibility for control squarely on the shoulders of the angry   individual. There is no room in this dangerous situation for "whys" and   "becauses." Instead, Rage offers no-nonsense, step-by-step anger management   tools that really work.'

She describes the structure of the independent reading workshop and other components of a balanced literacy program that work together to ensure young students grow into strong, well-rounded readers.  Kathy outlines a sequence of possible units of study for a yearlong curriculum.  Chapters are devoted to the individual units of study and include a sample curriculum as well as examples of mini-lessons and reading conferences.  There are also four \x93Getting Ready\x94 sections that suggest some behind-the-scenes work teachers can do to prepare for the units. Topics explored in these units include:<ul><li>print and comprehension strategies;</li><li>reading in genres such as poetry and nonfiction;</li><li>connecting in-school reading and out-of-school reading;</li><li>developing the strategies and habits of lifelong readers.</li></ul></p><p>A series of planning sheets and management tips are presented throughout to help ensure smooth implementation.</p><p>We want our students to learn to read, and we want them to love to read.

p2380
S'Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD) is a condition affecting at least one in twenty children who experience sensations in taste, touch, sound, sight, smell, movement, and body awareness in a vastly different manner from how other children their ages do.

S'<P>Life is getting better\x97and at an accelerating rate. Food availability, income, and life span are up; disease, child mortality, and violence are down \x97 all across the globe. Though the world is far from perfect, necessities and luxuries alike are getting cheaper; population growth is slowing; Africa is following Asia out of poverty; the Internet, the mobile phone, and container shipping are enriching people\x92s lives as never before. The pessimists who dominate public discourse insist that we will soon reach a turning point and things will start to get worse. But they have been saying this for two hundred years.</P> <P>Yet Matt Ridley does more than describe how things are getting better. He explains why. Prosperity comes from everybody working for everybody else. The habit of exchange and specialization\x97which started more than 100,000 years ago\x97has created a collective brain that sets human living standards on a rising trend. The mutual dependence, trust, and sharing that result are causes for hope, not despair.</P> <P>This bold book covers the entire sweep of human history, from the Stone Age to the Internet, from the stagnation of the Ming empire to the invention of the steam engine, from the population explosion to the likely consequences of climate change. It ends with a confident assertion that thanks to the ceaseless capacity of the human race for innovative change, and despite inevitable disasters along the way, the twenty-first century will see both human prosperity and natural biodiversity enhanced. Acute, refreshing, and revelatory, The Rational Optimist will change your way of thinking about the world for the better. </P>'

She urges readers to think back to the kinds of diets that their grandmothers ate, regimens full of foods fresh from farms and from individual purveyors: meats, dairy, and seasonal fruits and vegetables. Planck has a lot to offer about the role of fats in a healthy diet. Although most nutritionists worry about people consuming too much fat, Planck distinguishes good fats from bad, noting that many vital nutrients are absorbed into the body only dissolved in fat. She describes the differences between industrial fats that have been chemically saturated and hydrogenated and those fats that occur naturally in vegetables, fish, and meats, especially lauding the benefits of homemade lard. Planck draws a similar line between natural and industrial soy foods. She also encourages people to consume much more seafood, finding the threat of mercury contamination a bit overblown. Above all, Planck links good nutrition to sensible enjoyment of food in all its variety."?<B>Mark Knoblauch, <I>Booklist</I></B></DIV><DIV>\xa0</DIV><DIV>"Nina Planck is a good, stylish writer and a dogged researcher who writes directly, forthrightly and with an edge. She isn\'t afraid to make the occasional wisecrack (\'No doubt, for some people, cracking open an egg is one chore too many\') while taking unpopular positions. Her chosen field?she is a champion of \'real\' (as opposed to industrialized) food?is one in which unpopular positions are easy to find. As Planck reveals, in her compellingly smart <I>Real Food: What to Eat and Why</I>, much of what we have learned about nutrition in the past generation or so is either misinformed or dead wrong, and almost all of the food invented in the last century, and especially since the Second World War, is worse than almost all of the food that we\'ve been eating since we developed agriculture. This means, she says, that butter is better than margarine (so, for that matter, is lard); that whole eggs (especially those laid by hens who scratch around in the dirt) are better than egg whites, and that eggs in general are an integral part of a sound diet; that full-fat milk is preferable to skim, raw preferable to pasteurized, au naturel preferable to homogenized. She goes so far as to maintain?horror of horrors?that chopped liver mixed with real schmaltz and hard-boiled eggs is, in a very real way, a form of health food. Like those who\'ve paved the way before her, she urges us to eat in a natural, old-fashioned way. But unlike many of them, and unlike her sometimes overbearing compatriots in the Slow Food movement, she is far from dogmatic, making her case casually, gently, persuasively. And personally, Planck\'s philosophy grows directly out of her life history, which included a pair of well-educated parents who decided, when the author was two, to pull up stakes in Buffalo, N.Y., and take up farming in northern Virginia. Planck, therefore, grew up among that odd combination of rural farming intellectuals who not only wanted to raise food for a living but could explain why it made sense. Planck, who is now an author and a creator and manager of farmers\' markets, has a message that can be?and is?summed up in straightforward and simple fashion in her first couple of chapters. She then goes on to build her case elaborately, citing both recent and venerable studies, concluding in the end that the only sensible path for eating, the one that maintains and even improves health, the one that maintains stable weight and avoids obesity, happens to be the one that we all crave: not modern food, but traditional food, and not industrial food, but real food."?<B>Mark Bittman, <I>Publishers Weekly</I></B></DIV></DIV>'

S'David Kessler, one of the most renowned experts on death and grief, takes on three uniquely shared experiences that challenge our ability to explain and fully understand the mystery of our final days. The first is -visions.- As the dying lose sight of this world, some people appear to be looking into the world to come. The second shared experience is getting ready for a -trip.- These trips may seem to us to be all about leaving, but for the dying, they may be about arriving. Finally, the third phenomenon is -crowded rooms.- The dying often talk about seeing a room full of people, as they constantly repeat the word crowded. In truth, we never die alone. Just as loving hands greeted us when we were born, so will loving arms embrace us when we die. In the tapestry of life and death, we may begin to see connections to the past that we missed in life. While death may look like a loss to the living, the last hours of a dying person may be filled not with emptiness, but rather with fullness.  In this fascinating book, David brings us stunning stories from the bedsides of the dying that will educate, enlighten, and comfort us all.'

Here\'s why: while   at medical school, doctors learn a very drug-intensive style of medicine,   because multinational pharmaceutical companies (\x93Big Pharma\x94) funds the medical   schools. As a result, most doctors are still thinking \x93inside the box\x94 when it   comes to cancer treatments. The \x93cancer box\x94 is largely the creation of Big   Pharma attempting to peddle their poisons (such as chemotherapy) in an effort to   increase shareholder profits. Sadly, these profits are generated at the expense   of cancer patients. <br>  <br>  In the words of radio talk show icon, Jeff Rense, \x93<i>I have been involved with   so called \'alternative approaches to cancer\' for a long time. This book is \'the   Bible\' - buy it and you will be amazed. It is a masterpiece.</i>" This book   succinctly explains the facts and deceptions about cancer and cancer treatments,   it documents multiple cases of persecution and suppression of effective natural   cancer treatments, it details the most potent advanced cancer treatment   protocols, and it clearly explains the relationship between nutrition and   cancer. The author is not a medical doctor. He is a \x93researcher\x94 who has   compiled the most concise, easily readable, comprehensive book on alternative   cancer treatments and health. This book is a \x93gold mine\x94 of information, helpful   to cancer patients, those attempting to prevent cancer, and health care   practitioners alike. <br>  <br>  According to Dr. Pavel Yakovlev (Oncosurgeon in the Ukraine), \x93<i>the material   in your book is enriching and hope-giving for clinical practice \x85 I made many   notes while reading it to be applied to my work.</i>\x94 Elaine Hulliberger, breast   cancer survivor, states: \x93<i>I had terminal cancer and used Ty Bollinger\'s   information on non-toxic supplements and the nutritional information along with   traditional medicine. Anyone who has cancer, or knows someone with cancer should   get this book and read it from cover to cover. I\'m alive today because I did</i>.\x94</p>    </body>'

p2487
S'<B>In this brave, beautiful, and deeply personal memoir, Laura Bush, one of our most beloved and private first ladies, tells her own extraordinary story.\xa0</B><P>Born in the boom-and-bust oil town of Midland, Texas, Laura Welch grew up as an only child in a family that lost three babies to miscarriage or infant death. She vividly evokes Midland\'s brash, rugged culture, her close relationship with her father, and the bonds of early friendships that sustain her to this day. For the first time, in heart-wrenching detail, she writes about the devastating high school car accident that left her friend Mike Douglas dead and about her decades of unspoken grief.<P>When Laura Welch first left West Texas in 1964, she never imagined that her journey would lead her to the world stage and the White House. After graduating from Southern Methodist University in 1968, in the thick of student rebellions across the country and at the dawn of the women\'s movement, she became an elementary school teacher, working in inner-city schools, then trained to be a librarian. At age thirty, she met George W. Bush, whom she had last passed in the hallway in seventh grade. Three months later, "the old maid of Midland married Midland\'s most eligible bachelor." With rare intimacy and candor, Laura Bush writes about her early married life as she was thrust into one of America\'s most prominent political families, as well as her deep longing for children and her husband\'s decision to give up drinking. By 1993, she found herself in the full glare of the political spotlight. But just as her husband won the Texas governorship in a stunning upset victory, her father, Harold Welch, was dying in Midland.<P>In 2001, after one of the closest elections in American history, Laura Bush moved into the White House. Here she captures presidential life in the harrowing days and weeks after 9/11, when fighter-jet cover echoed through the walls and security scares sent the family to an underground shelter. She writes openly about the White House during wartime, the withering and relentless media spotlight, and the transformation of her role as she began to understand the power of the first lady. One of the first U.S. officials to visit war-torn Afghanistan, she also reached out to disease-stricken African nations and tirelessly advocated for women in the Middle East and dissidents in Burma. She championed programs to get kids out of gangs and to stop urban violence. And she was a major force in rebuilding Gulf Coast schools and libraries post-Katrina. Movingly, she writes of her visits with U.S. troops and their loved ones, and of her empathy for and immense gratitude to military families.<P>With deft humor and a sharp eye, Laura Bush lifts the curtain on what really happens inside the White House, from presidential finances to the 175-year-old tradition of separate bedrooms for presidents and their wives to the antics of some White House guests and even a few members of Congress. She writes with honesty and eloquence about her family, her public triumphs, and her personal tribulations. Laura Bush\'s compassion, her sense of humor, her grace, and her uncommon willingness to bare her heart make this story revelatory, beautifully rendered, and unlike any other first lady\'s memoir ever written.'

Now Carr expands his argument into the most compelling exploration of the Internet\x92s intellectual and cultural consequences yet published. Weaving insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and history into a rich narrative, The Shallows explains how the Net is rerouting our neural pathways, replacing the subtle mind of the book reader with the distracted mind of the screen watcher.

S"A clinical psychiatrist explores the effects of DMT, one of  the most powerful psychedelics known.<br>    * A behind-the-scenes look at the cutting edge of psychedelic  research.<br>    * Provides a unique scientific explanation for the phenomenon of alien  abduction experiences.<br>    <P>From 1990 to 1995 Dr. Rick Strassman conducted DEA-approved clinical research at the University of New Mexico in which he injected sixty volunteers with DMT, one of the most powerful psychedelics known. His detailed account of those sessions is an extraordinarily riveting inquiry into the nature of the human mind and the therapeutic potential of psychedelics. DMT, a plant-derived chemical that is also manufactured by the human brain, consistently produced out-of-body, near-death, and mystical experiences. Many volunteers reported convincing encounters with intelligent nonhuman presences: angels, aliens, spirits. Nearly all agreed that the sessions were among the most intense experiences of their lives.    <P>Strassman's research connects dmt with the pineal gland, considered by Hindus to be the site of the sixth chakra and by Rene Descartes to be the seat of the soul. DMT: The Spirit Molecule makes the bold case that DMT, naturally released by the pineal gland, facilitates the soul's movement in and out of the body and is an integral part of the birth and death experiences, as well as the highest states of meditation and even sexual transcendence. Strassman also believes that alien abduction experiences are brought on by accidental releases of DMT. If used wisely, dmt could trigger a period of remarkable progress in the scientific exploration of the most mystical regions of the human mind and soul."

(S'36 Arguments for the Existence of God: A Work of Fiction'
p2586
S'After Cass Seltzer\x92s book becomes a surprise best seller, he\x92s dubbed \x93the atheist with a soul\x94 and becomes a celebrity. He wins over the stunning Lucinda Mandelbaum, \x93the goddess of game theory,\x94 and loses himself in a spiritually expansive infatuation. A former girlfriend appears: an anthropologist who invites him to join in her quest for immortality through biochemistry. And he is haunted by reminders of the two people who ignited his passion to understand religion: his mentor and professor\x97a renowned literary scholar with a suspicious obsession with messianism\x97and an angelic six-year-old mathematical genius who is heir to the leadership of a Hasidic sect. Each encounter reinforces Cass\x92s theory that the religious impulse spills over into life at large.<br>\xa0<br><i>36 Arguments for the Existence of God</i> plunges into the great debate of our day: the clash between faith and reason. World events are being shaped by fervent believers at home and abroad, while a new atheism is asserting itself in the public sphere. On purely intellectual grounds the skeptics would seem to have everything on their side. Yet people refuse to accept their seemingly irrefutable arguments and continue to embrace faith in God as their source of meaning, purpose, and comfort. <br>\xa0<br>Through the enchantment of fiction, award-winning novelist and MacArthur Fellow Rebecca Newberger Goldstein shows that the tension between religion and doubt cannot be understood through rational argument alone. It also must be explored from the point of view of individual people caught in the raptures and torments of religious experience in all their variety.<br>\xa0<br>Using her gifts in fiction and philosophy, Goldstein has produced a true crossover novel, complete with a nail-biting debate (\x93Resolved: God Exists\x94) and a stand-alone appendix with the thirty-six arguments (and responses) that propelled Seltzer to stardom.'

You <i>must</i> go to the gym five times a week, <i>never</i> order the dessert, and don't even <i>think</i> about buying that dress you keep staring at in the store window. Breaking from such a regimented lifestyle is a sign of weakness, right? Wrong!-and Joyce wants to tell us why...<br><br>Though setting rules in our lives are important, it's just as important that we break them from time-to-time. Structure is a powerful tool, but when diverging from your own goals is seen as catastrophic, it can have a hugely negative effect on us.

(S'Christian Beliefs: Twenty Basics Every Christian Should Know'
p2601
S"Christian Essentials Made Plain and Simple    God doesn't call every Christian to go off to seminary, but there are certain matters of doctrine---that is, the church's teaching---that every Christian simply must know. Theology is important because what we believe affects how we live. If you're a relatively new believer in Jesus, or if you're a more mature Christian looking for a quick brush-up on basics of the faith, Christian Beliefs is for you.    This readable guide to twenty basic Christian beliefs is a condensation of Wayne Grudem's award-winning book on systematic theology, prized by pastors and teachers everywhere. He and his son, Elliot, have boiled down the essentials of Christian theology for the average layperson and made them both clear and applicable to life. You will learn about the Bible, the characteristics of God, what it means that we are created in the image of God, what God has done for us in Christ, the purpose of the church, and much more. Each chapter includes questions for personal review or group discussion.    These truly are twenty basic beliefs that every Christian should know. Wayne Grudem is a master teacher with the ability to explain profound truths in simple language. He is a man of deep conviction and theological passion---and those who read this book will be both educated and encouraged in the faith.  R. Albert Mohler Jr., President, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky    Based on Systematic Theology, this summary will certainly help beginners with Christ to get the hang of their faith.  J. I. Packer, Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia    As Wayne Grudem's Systematic Theology contracts into a compact book, I do not lose my enthusiasm for the truth he loves and the clarity of his words.

S'Ten superb new stories by one of our most beloved and admired writers\x97the winner of the 2009 Man Booker International Prize. <br><br>In the first story a young wife and mother receives release from the unbearable pain of losing her three children from a most surprising source. In another, a young woman, in the aftermath of an unusual and humiliating seduction, reacts in a clever if less-than-admirable fashion. Other stories uncover the \x93deep-holes\x94 in a marriage, the unsuspected cruelty of children, and how a boy\x92s disfigured face provides both the good things in his life and the bad. And in the long title story, we accompany Sophia Kovalevsky\x97a late-nineteenth-century Russian \xe9migr\xe9 and mathematician\x97on a winter journey that takes her from the Riviera, where she visits her lover, to Paris, Germany, and, Denmark, where she has a fateful meeting with a local doctor, and finally to Sweden, where she teaches at the only university in Europe willing to employ a female mathematician.<br><br>With clarity and ease, Alice Munro once again renders complex, difficult events and emotions into stories that shed light on the unpredictable ways in which men and women accommodate and often transcend what happens in their lives.<br><br><i>Too Much Happiness </i>is a compelling, provocative\x97even daring\x97collection.'

Narayan with the literary sophistication and stylishness of Jhumpa Lahiri.\x94\x97<em>Financial Times</em></strong>  Passing from the mannered drawing rooms of Pakistan\x92s cities to the harsh mud villages beyond, Daniyal Mueenuddin\x92s linked stories describe the interwoven lives of an aging feudal landowner, his servants and managers, and his extended family, industrialists who have lost touch with the land. In the spirit of Joyce\x92s <em>Dubliners</em> and Turgenev\x92s <em>A Sportsman\x92s Sketches</em>, these stories comprehensively illuminate a world, describing members of parliament and farm workers, Islamabad society girls and desperate servant women. A hard-driven politician at the height of his powers falls critically ill and seeks to perpetuate his legacy; a girl from a declining Lahori family becomes a wealthy relative\x92s mistress, thinking there will be no cost; an electrician confronts a violent assailant in order to protect his most valuable possession; a maidservant who advances herself through sexual favors unexpectedly falls in love. <br />  <br />  Together the stories in <em>In Other Rooms, Other Wonders</em> make up a vivid portrait of feudal Pakistan, describing the advantages and constraints of social station, the dissolution of old ways, and the shock of change.

In a society where the ability to see the higher end of the color spectrum denotes a better social standing, Eddie Russet belongs to the low-level House of Red and can see his own color\x97but no other. The sky, the grass, and everything in between are all just shades of grey, and must be colorized by artificial means.<BR><BR> Eddie's world wasn't always like this. There's evidence of a never-discussed disaster and now, many years later, technology is poor, news sporadic, the notion of change abhorrent, and nighttime is terrifying: no one can see in the dark. Everyone abides by a bizarre regime of rules and regulations, a system of merits and demerits, where punishment can result in permanent expulsion.<BR><BR> Eddie, who works for the Color Control Agency, might well have lived out his rose-tinted life without a hitch. But that changes when he becomes smitten with Jane, a Grey Nightseer from the dark, unlit side of the village. She shows Eddie that all is not well with the world he thinks is just and good.

Why do we have pews, steeples, choirs, and seminaries? This volume reveals the startling truth: most of what Christians do in present-day churches is not rooted in the New Testament, but in pagan culture and rituals developed long after the death of the apostles.

S"Investigator Arkady Renko, the pariah of the Moscow prosecutor's office, has been assigned the thankless job of investigating a new phenomenon: late-night subway riders report seeing the ghost of Joseph Stalin on the platform of the Chistye Prudy Metro station. The illusion seems part political hocus-pocus and also part wishful thinking, for among many Russians Stalin is again popular; the bloody dictator can boast a two-to-one approval rating. Decidedly better than that of Renko, whose lover, Eva, has left him for Detective Nikolai Isakov, a charismatic veteran of the civil war in Chechnya, a hero of the far right and, Renko suspects, a killer for hire. The cases entwine, and Renko's quests become a personal inquiry fueled by jealousy.<P>The investigation leads to the fields of Tver outside of Moscow, where once a million soldiers fought. There, amidst the detritus, Renko must confront the ghost of his own father, a favorite general of Stalin's. In these barren fields, patriots and shady entrepreneurs -- the Red Diggers and Black Diggers -- collect the bones, weapons and personal effects of slain World War II soldiers, and find that even among the dead there are surprises."

With over 550 instructional black-and-white illustrations and an approach that assumes no prior watch-repairing experience, this book achieves and surpasses that lofty mission, and has been touted as "the best illustrated book on practical horology" (<em>Horological Journal</em>) ever written. For the readers in his audience, de Carle has provided well-informed discourse on every topic a watchmaker, or aspiring watchmaker, needs to know. With <em>Practical Watch Repairing</em>, even a layman can become a watch-repair specialist.<br /> 553 b/w illustrations.'

S'Why is justice fair? Why are so many people pursuing spirituality? Why do we crave relationship? And why is beauty so beautiful? N. T. Wright argues that each of these questions takes us into the mystery of who God is and what he wants from us. For two thousand years Christianity has claimed to answer these mysteries, and this renowned biblical scholar and Anglican bishop shows that it still does today. Like C. S. Lewis did in his classic Mere Christianity, Wright makes the case for Christian faith from the ground up, assuming that the reader is starting from ground zero with no predisposition to and perhaps even some negativity toward religion in general and Christianity in particular. His goal is to describe Christianity in as simple and accessible, yet hopefully attractive and exciting, a way as possible, both to say to outsides \xd4You might want to look at this further,\xd6 and to say to insiders \xd4You may not have quite understood this bit clearly yet.\xd6'

p2814
S"Beyond Consequences, Logic, and Control covers in detail the effects of trauma on the body-mind and how trauma alters children's behavioral responses. The first four chapters help parents and professionals clearly understand the neurological research behind the basic model given in this book, deemed, 'The Stress Model.' While scientifically based in research, it is written in an easy to understand and easy to grasp format for anyone working with or parenting children with severe behaviors. The next seven chapters are individually devoted to seven behaviors typically seen with attachment-challenged children. These include lying, stealing, hoarding and gorging, aggression, defiance, lack of eye contact, and yes, even a chapter that talks candidly about how parents appear hostile and angry when they work to simply maintain their families from reaching complete states of chaos. Each of these chapters talks in depth on these specific behaviors and gives vivid and contrasting examples of how this love-based approach works to foster healing and works to develop relationships, as opposed to the fear-based traditional attachment parenting approaches that are being advocated in today's attachment field. The authors end with a Parenting Bonus Section: true testimonials from parents who have been able to make significant changes in their homes with this model of parenting, giving real-life examples of how they have been able to find the healing, peace, and love that they had been seeking prior to working through the techniques outlined in this book."

S"Beating Cancer with Nutrition. Sugar feeds Cancer: diet and supplements can starve tumors\xc2\xb7 Nutrition makes chemo and radiation more toxic to the tumor while protecting the patient. Nutrition changes underlying causes of cancer, improving outcome for cancer patients regardless of other therapies. Why Beating Cancer with Nutrition is unique: The book was developed after working with over 500 cancer patients and organizing 3 international symposiums on the subject. The information contained in BCN is both scientifically backed with references and clinically proven in the hospital with patients. This information helps cancer patients to improve quality and quantity of life. BCN had been translated into Japanese and Chinese and is being translated into Korean. BCN had become a home study continuing education course for registered nurses. BCN 2001 version will contain a 72-minute audio CD version in response to the requests from tired cancer patients who said they needed and audio version of the book to get started. BCN had sold 110,000 copies in 7 years in print, which is impressive for small publishers. Why Patrick Quillin is Unique: For the past 10 years, Dr. Patrick Quillin has served as the Director of Nutrition for Cancer Treatment Centers of America. He is an internationally respected expert in the area of nutrition and cancer. He has earned his bachelor's, Master's and doctorate degrees in nutrition and is a registered and licensed dietitian ( RD & LD) and Certified Nutrition Specialist (CNS) with the American College of Nutrition."

p2869
S"Economist Raghuram Rajan warned about the global financial crisis long before it hit, but few listened. Now, as the world struggles to recover, it's tempting to blame the crisis on just a few greedy bankers who took irrational risks and left the rest of us to foot the bill. In Fault Lines, Rajan argues that serious flaws in the economy are also to blame, and warns that a potentially more devastating crisis awaits us if they aren't fixed. Can we risk not listening to him a second time? Rajan shows how the individual choices that collectively brought about the economic meltdown--made by bankers, government officials, and ordinary homeowners--were rational responses to a flawed global financial order in which the incentives to take on risk are incredibly out of step with the dangers those risks pose. He traces the deepening fault lines in a system overly dependent on American consumption to power the world economy and stave off a global downturn; a system where America's thin social safety net has created tremendous political pressure to keep job creation robust, because jobs are the primary provider of health and other benefits; and where the U.S. financial sector, with its skewed incentives, is the critical but unstable link between an overstimulated America and an underconsuming world. Rajan demonstrates how inequalities in U.S. incomes, education, and health care are putting all of us into deeper financial peril, and he outlines sensible reforms to ensure a more stable world economy and to restore lasting prosperity."

Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.<br><br>They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.<br><br>Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women\x92s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy.

p2904
S'<B>The first authoritative history of hedge funds-from their rebel beginnings to their role in defining the future of finance. </B> <BR><BR> Based on author Sebastian Mallaby\'s unprecedented access to the industry, including three hundred hours of interviews, <I>More Money Than God</I> tells the inside story of hedge funds, from their origins in the 1960s and 1970s to their role in the financial crisis of 2007- 2009. <BR><BR> Wealthy, powerful, and potentially dangerous, hedge fund moguls have become the It Boys of twenty-first\xadcentury capitalism. Ken Griffin of Citadel started out trading convertible bonds from his dorm room at Harvard. Julian Robertson staffed his hedge fund with college athletes half his age, then he flew them to various retreats in the Rockies and raced them up the mountains. Paul Tudor Jones posed for a magazine photograph next to a killer shark and happily declared that a 1929- style crash would be "total rock-and-roll" for him. Michael Steinhardt was capable of reducing underlings to sobs. "All I want to do is kill myself," one said. "Can I watch?" Steinhardt responded. <BR><BR> Finance professors have long argued that beating the market is impossible, and yet drawing on insights from physics, economics, and psychology, these titans have cracked the market\'s mysteries and gone on to earn fortunes. Their innovation has transformed the world, spawning new markets in exotic financial instruments and rewriting the rules of capitalism. <BR><BR> More than just a history, <I>More Money Than God</I> is a window on tomorrow\'s financial system. Hedge funds have been left for dead after past financial panics: After the stock market rout of the early 1970s, after the bond market bloodbath of 1994, after the collapse of Long Term Capital Management in 1998, and yet again after the dot-com crash in 2000. Each time, hedge funds have proved to be survivors, and it would be wrong to bet against them now. Banks such as CitiGroup, brokers such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, home lenders such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, insurers such as AIG, and money market funds run by giants such as Fidelity-all have failed or been bailed out. But the hedge fund industry has survived the test of 2008 far better than its rivals. The future of finance lies in the history of hedge funds.'

S'<b>"If you believe it\'s time to put principles above parties, character above campaign promises, and <I>Common Sense</i> above all -- then I ask you to read this book...."</b>  <P> In any era, great Americans inspire us to reach our full potential. They know with conviction what they believe within themselves. They understand that all actions have consequences. And they find commonsense solutions to the nation\'s problems.  <P> One such American, Thomas Paine, was an ordinary man who changed the course of history by penning <I>Common Sense</i>, the concise 1776 masterpiece in which, through extraordinarily straightforward and indisputable arguments, he encouraged his fellow citizens to take control of America\'s future -- and, ultimately, her freedom.  <P> Nearly two and a half centuries later, those very freedoms once again hang in the balance.

S'Conservative talk radio\'s fastest-growing superstar is also a <I>New York Times</i> bestselling phenomenon: the author of the groundbreaking critique of the Supreme Court, <I>Men in Black</i>, and the deeply personal dog lover\'s memoir <I>Rescuing Sprite</i>, Mark R. Levin now delivers the book that characterizes both his devotion to his more than 5 million listeners and his love of our country and the legacy of our Founding Fathers: <I>Liberty and Tyranny</i> is Mark R. Levin\'s clarion call to conservative America, a new manifesto for the conservative movement for the 21st century.  <P> In the face of the modern liberal assault on Constitution-based values, an attack that has steadily snowballed since President Roosevelt\'s New Deal of the 1930s and resulted in a federal government that is a massive, unaccountable conglomerate, the time for re-enforcing the intellectual and practical case for conservatism is <I>now</i>. Conservative beliefs in individual freedoms do in the end stand for liberty for all Americans, while liberal dictates lead to the breakdown of civilized society -- in short, tyranny. Looking back to look to the future, Levin writes "conservatism is the antidote to tyranny precisely because its principles <I>are</i> our founding principles." And in a series of powerful essays, Levin lays out how conservatives can counter the liberal corrosion that has filtered into every timely issue affecting our daily lives, from the economy to health care, global warming, immigration, and more -- and illustrates how change, as seen through the conservative lens, is always prudent, and always an enhancement to individual freedom.  <P> As provocative, well-reasoned, robust, and informed as his on-air commentary, Levin\'s narrative will galvanize readers to begin a new era in conservative thinking and action. <I>Liberty and Tyranny</i> provides a philosophical, historical, and practical framework for revitalizing the conservative vision and ensuring the preservation of American society.'

(S'A Short History of Nearly Everything'
p2924
S'One of the world\x92s most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.<br><br>In <b>A Walk in the Woods</b>, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In <b>In A Sunburned Country</b>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\x92s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it. Science has never been more involving or entertaining.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p2939
S'Growing up in the eighties, you were surrounded by mysteries. These were the years of MTV and John Hughes movies, the era of big dreams and bigger shoulder pads. Like any teenage geek, Rob Sheffield spent the decade searching for true love and maybe a cooler haircut. <I>Talking to Girls About Duran Duran</I> is his tale of stumbling into adulthood with a killer soundtrack. Inept flirtations. Dumb crushes. Deplorable fashion choices. Girls, every last one of whom was madly in love with the bassist of Duran Duran. <BR><BR> In his first book, the national bestseller <I>Love Is a Mix Tape</I>, Sheffield shared a heartbreaking true story of love and grief. With <I>Talking to Girls About Duran Duran</I>, he returns with a smart, funny, and emotionally pitch-perfect trip through the music and memories of the eighties. As a confused teenager stranded in the suburbs, mowing lawns, and playing video games, Rob had a lot to learn about women, love, music, and himself. But he was sure his radio had all the answers, whether he was driving an ice cream truck through Boston to "Purple Rain," slam dancing to The Replacements, or pondering the implications of Madonna lyrics. <BR><BR> From Bowie to Bobby Brown, from hair metal to hip-hop, he loved them all. <I>Talking to Girls About Duran Duran</I> is a journey through pop culture of an American adolescence that will remind you of your first crush, first car, and first kiss. But it\'s not just a book about music. This is a book about moments in time, and the way we obsess over them through the years. Every song is a snapshot of a moment that helps form the rest of your life. Whenever you grew up, and whatever your teenage obsessions, <I>Talking to Girls About Duran Duran</I> brings those moments to life.'

S'Lust isn\'t just a guy problem \x96 it\'s a human problem. And unless we honestly confront it, lust will destroy our relationships and our lives. Joshua Harris, author of the runaway bestseller <i>I Kissed Dating Goodbye, </i>calls a generation bombarded with images of sexual sin back to the freedom and joy of holiness. This "PG-rated" book \x96 straightforward without being graphic \x96 speaks to those entrenched in lust or just flirting with temptation. Honestly sharing his own struggles, Harris exposes lust\'s tactics and helps readers create a personal plan for fighting back. Men and women will find hope in God\'s grace and learn the secrets to lasting change. <br><br>Neither sex nor sexuality is our enemy. We need to rescue our sexuality from lust so we can experience it as God intended.  <br><br>Bestselling author Joshua Harris shows you how lust deceives you.

p2984
S'Helping men rediscover their masculine heart, this guide to understanding Christian manhood and Christian men offers a refreshing break from the chorus of voices urging men to be more responsible, reliable, dutiful\x85 and dead. God designed men to be dangerous, says John Eldredge. Simply look at the dreams and desires written in the heart of every boy: To be a hero, to be a warrior, to live a life of adventure and risk. Sadly, most men abandon those dreams and desires-aided by a Christianity that feels like nothing more than pressure to be a "nice guy." It is no wonder that many men avoid church, and those who go are often passive and bored to death. In this provocative book, now available in trade paper, Eldredge gives women a look inside the true heart of a man and gives men permission to be what God designed them to be-dangerous, passionate, alive, and free.'

As young women, they moved to eight different states, yet managed to maintain an enduring friendship that would carry them through college and careers, marriage and motherhood, dating and divorce, a child's illness and the mysterious death of one member of their group.  Capturing their remarkable story, <I>The Girls from Ames</I> is a testament to the deep bonds of women as they experience life's joys and challenges -- and the power of friendship to triumph over heartbreak and unexpected tragedy.<BR><BR> The girls, now in their forties, have a lifetime of memories in common, some evocative of their generation and some that will resonate with any woman who has ever had a friend.  Photograph by photograph, recollection by recollection, occasionally with tears and often with great laughter, their sweeping and moving story is shared by Jeffrey Zaslow, <i>Wall Street Journal</I> columnist, as he attempts to define the matchless bonds of female friendship.  It demonstrates how close female relationships can shape every aspect of women's lives - their sense of themselves, their choice of men, their need for validation, their relationships with their mothers, their dreams for their daughters - and reveals how such friendships thrive, rewarding those who have committed to them.<BR><BR> <I>The Girls from Ames</I> is the story of a group of ordinary women who built an extraordinary friendship.

In <I>The Language of God</i> he makes his case for God and for science. He has heard every argument against faith from scientists, and he can refute them. He has also heard the needless rejection of scientific truths by some people of faith, and he can counter that, too. He explains his own journey from atheism to faith, and then takes readers for a stunning tour of modern science to show that physics, chemistry, and biology can all fit together with belief in God and the Bible. <I>The Language of God</i> is essential reading for anyone who wonders about the deepest questions of faith: Why are we here? How did we get here? What does life mean?"

Patricia Love and Steven Stosny have studied this all-too-familiar dynamic between men and women and have reached a truly shocking conclusion. Even with the best of intentions, talking about your relationship doesn\x92t bring you together, and it will eventually drive you apart. <br><br>The reason for this is that underneath most couples\x92 fights, there is a biological difference at work. A woman\x92s vulnerability to fear and anxiety makes her draw closer, while a man\x92s subtle sensitivity to shame makes him pull away in response. This is why so many married couples fall into the archetypal roles of nagging wife/stonewalling husband, and why improving a marriage can\x92t happen through words. <br><br><i>How to Improve Your Marriage Without Talking About It</i> teaches couples how to get closer in ways that don\x92t require \x93trying to turn a man into a woman.\x94 Rich in stories of couples who have turned their marriages around, and full of practical advice about the behaviors that make and break marriages, this essential guide will help couples find love beyond words."

p3094
S'<DIV>Walk into any racially mixed high school and you will see black youth seated together in the cafeteria. Of course, it\'s not just the black kids sitting together-the white, Latino, Asian Pacific, and, in some regions, American Indian youth are clustered in their own groups, too. The same phenomenon can be observed in college dining halls, faculty lounges, and corporate cafeterias. What is going on here? Is this self-segregation a problem we should try to fix, or a coping strategy we should support? How can we get past our reluctance to talk about racial issues to even discuss it? And what about all the other questions we and our children have about race? Beverly Daniel Tatum, a renowned authority on the psychology of racism, asserts that we do not know how to talk about our racial differences: Whites are afraid of using the wrong words and being perceived as "racist" while parents of color are afraid of exposing their children to painful racial realities too soon. Using real-life examples and the latest research, Tatum presents strong evidence that straight talk about our racial identities-whatever they may be-is essential if we are serious about facilitating communication across racial and ethnic divides. We have waited far too long to begin our conversations about race. This remarkable book, infused with great wisdom and humanity, has already helped hundreds of thousands of readers figure out where to start.</Div>'

S'Available for the first time in trade paperback--this provocative book is "an anthem sung in praise of man\'s ego"--from the legendary author Ayn Rand<br><br><i>Anthem</i> has long been hailed as one of Ayn Rand\'s classic novels, and a clear predecessor to her later masterpieces, <i>The Fountainhead</i> and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>. In <i>Anthem</i>, Rand examines a frightening future in which individuals have no name, no independence, and no values. Equality 7-2521 lives in the dark ages of the future where all decisions are made by committee, all people live in collectives, and all traces of individualism have been wiped out. Despite such a restrictive environment, the spark of individual thought and freedom still burns in him--a passion which he has been taught to call sinful. In a purely egalitarian world, Equality 7-2521 dares to stand apart from the herd--to think and choose for himself, to discover electricity, and to love the woman of his choice. Now he has been marked for death for committing the ultimate sin. In a world where the great "we" reign supreme, he has rediscovered the lost and holy word--"I."'

S"Living as an Ordinary Radical    Many of us find ourselves caught somewhere between unbelieving activists and inactive believers. We can write a check to feed starving children or hold signs in the streets and feel like we've made a difference without ever encountering the faces of the suffering masses. In this book, Shane Claiborne describes an authentic faith rooted in belief, action, and love, inviting us into a movement of the Spirit that begins inside each of us and extends into a broken world. Shane's faith led him to dress the wounds of lepers with Mother Teresa, visit families in Iraq amidst bombings, and dump $10,000 in coins and bills on Wall Street to redistribute wealth. Shane lives out this revolution each day in his local neighborhood, an impoverished community in North Philadelphia, by living among the homeless, helping local kids with homework, and 'practicing resurrection' in the forgotten places of our world.     Shane's message will comfort the disturbed, and disturb the comfortable . . . but will also invite us into an irresistible revolution. His is a vision for ordinary radicals ready to change the world with little acts of love."

S'In the rush of modern life, we tend to lose touch with the peace that is available in each moment. World-renowned Zen master, spiritual leader, and author Thich Nhat Hanh shows us how to make positive use of the very situations that usually pressure and antagonize us. For him a ringing telephone can be a signal to call us back to our true selves. Dirty dishes, red lights, and traffic jams are spiritual friends on the path to "mindfulness" -- the process of keeping our consciousness alive to our present experience and reality. The most profound satisfactions, the deepest feelings of joy and completeness lie as close at hand as our next aware breath and the smile we can form right now.<P>Lucidly and beautifully written, <i>Peace Is Every Step</i> contains commentaries and meditations, personal anecdotes and stories from Nhat Hanh\'s experiences as a peace activist, teacher, and community leader. It begins where the reader already is -- in the kitchen, office, driving a car, walking a part -- and shows how deep meditative presence is available now. Nhat Hanh provides exercises to increase our awareness of our own body and mind through conscious breathing, which can bring immediate joy and peace. Nhat Hanh also shows how to be aware of relationships with others and of the world around us, its beauty and also its pollution and injustices. the deceptively simple practices of <i>Peace Is Every Step</i> encourage the reader to work for peace in the world as he or she continues to work on sustaining inner peace by turning the "mindless" into the mindFUL.<P>"This book of illuminating reminders bid us to reorient the way we look at the world...toward a humanitarian perspective." --<i>Publisher Weekly</i>'

p3287
S'<i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> is at once a beautifully written account of an exceptional life and a profound introduction to the ancient science of Yoga and its time-honored tradition of meditation. This acclaimed autobiography presents a fascinating portrait of one of the great spiritual figures of our time. With engaging candor, eloquence, and wit, Paramahansa Yogananda tells the inspiring chronicle of his life: the experiences of his remarkable childhood, encounter with many saints and sages during his youthful search throughout India for an illumined teacher, ten years of training in the hermitage of a revered yoga master, and the thirty years that he lived and taught in America. Also recorded here are his meetings with Mahatma Gandhi, Rabindranath Tagore, Luther Burbank, the Catholic stigmatist Therese Neumann, and other celebrated spiritual personalities of East and West. The author clearly explains the subtle but definite laws behind both the ordinary events of everyday life and the extraordinary events commonly termed miracles. His absorbing life story becomes the background for a penetrating and unforgettable look at the ultimate mysteries of human existence. Selected as "One of the 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Twentieth Century," <i>Autobiography of a Yogi</i> has been translated into 20 languages, and is regarded worldwide as a classic of religious literature. Several million copies have been sold, and it continues to appear on best-seller lists after more than sixty consecutive years in print. Profoundly inspiring, it is at the same time vastly entertaining, warmly humorous and filled with extraordinary personages. <b>Self-Realization Fellowship\'s</b> editions, and none others, include extensive material added by the author after the first edition was published, including a final chapter on the closing years of his life.<P>'

p3312
S'The Summa Theologica (Latin: "Summary of Theology" or "Highest Theology") is the most famous work of Thomas Aquinas (1225\x961274). It was intended as a manual for beginners as a compilation of all of the main theological  teachings of the time. It summarizes the reasoning of all points of Christian theology, which before the Protestant Reformation subsisted solely in the Roman Catholic Church. The Summa\'s topics follow a cycle: the existence of God; God\'s creation, Man; Man\'s purpose; Christ; the Sacraments; and back to God. It is famous for its five arguments for the existence of God, the Quinquae viae (Latin: five ways). Throughout his work, Aquinas cites Augustine of Hippo, Aristotle, and other Christian, Jewish, Muslim and ancient pagan scholars.<br><br>This is an electronic edition of the complete book and includes an author biography.

(S'Lightroom 3: Streamlining Your Digital Photography Process'
p3317
S'"I\x92ve worked my entire adult life in digital imaging, from managing high-volume production departments to running my own photography and printing businesses. And for many years, I\x92ve been teaching photographers how to be self-sufficient when it comes to working with their digital images.<br>    <br>    Having used all major image editing software released over the past twenty years, I now choose to use Lightroom because it allows me to work quickly, helps me deal with large numbers of images and lets me get back to enjoying the creative aspects of photography.<br>    <br>    From my experience, I know how hard it can be to learn new ways of doing things\x96especially computer stuff. Unfortunately for a lot of photographers, struggling with digital processing can take the fun out of photography. Trying to figure out the intricacies of file formats, resolution, color management, etc., and even simply where to put all the files can be daunting tasks. Worse yet, sometimes it\x92s hard just to know the right steps to get the best quality from a single photo!<br>    <br>    It\x92s my mission to ease your pain; to show you that you really can be in control of your entire imaging process, and help you develop a personalized workflow that fits your style and needs. My students frequently tell me how liberating this is: to comfortably handle all the files coming off the camera and residing on hard disks, to work methodically through a known sequence of steps and to produce finished pictures that you\x92re proud to show other people. This is at the heart of the photographer\x92s experience, and I want you to know this sense of confidence and capability.<br>    <br>    I\x92ve taught large groups and individual photographers alike. Over the years I\x92ve learned where people get stuck. I understand the pitfalls new users face when first starting to use Lightroom as well as the concerns of more experienced users looking for ways to tweak their workflow for better performance. I want to help you overcome these challenges.<br>    <br>    My goal for this book is to teach you to effectively use Lightroom 3 as quickly and easily as possible. My writing has been heavily influenced by my experiences working with clients and students, and I\x92ve approached the content of this book as I would tutor someone in a one-on-one training session. The order in which concepts are presented and the emphasis I give to certain aspects of the workflow are unique among books of its kind.<br>    <br>    We\x92ll start by reviewing some important, basic principles, such as working with Lightroom catalogs, the Lightroom workflow, color management, and an introduction to Lightroom 3\x92s updated tools and screen interface. From there, we jump right in to importing images into Lightroom. This is followed by a step-by-step editing tutorial that will make your work much easier. Then we move on to in-depth explanations of how to perfect each photo for tone, color, contrast, sharpness and much more. After a detailed look at exporting images out of Lightroom, the next three chapters deal with presenting your work to others with prints, Web sites and slideshows. Finally, we\x92ll wrap up with an in-depth look at advanced techniques for integrating Lightroom with other software.<br>    <br>    The material presented in this book is appropriate for digital photographers working in all disciplines, at all skill levels. The information and tutorials are applicable to every kind of photography: from weddings and portraits to fine art landscape work, everyone can learn to streamline their digital photography process using Lightroom 3."    <p>    Nat Coalson<br>    Conifer, CO<br>    2010  <br><br>  <span class="h1"> <strong>Ten Lightroom 3 Tips for from Author Nat Coalson</strong> </span>   <p>    Whether you\x92re new to Lightroom or have been using it for a while, my new book, <i>Lightroom 3: Streamlining your Digital Photography Process</i> can help you master the tools, techniques and workflows to get the most from your photography with the least amount of effort. Below are some of my top tips for a solid foundation in Lightroom, all of which are covered in more detail in the book:</p>    <p>  <ul>  <strong>Top 5 tips if you\x92re new to Lightroom</strong>  <br><br>  <li> Lightroom uses a database, called a <i>catalog</i>, to manage your image files. When you import photos into Lightroom, the image files are not stored in the catalog. Lightroom simply references theoriginal files on your hard drive and creates links to them within the catalog. (However, all the work you do to photos is stored within the catalog.)</li><br>  <li> If you need to move, rename or delete photos after importing them into Lightroom, do it from within Lightroom (not using the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer). This ensures that the links in the Lightroom catalog will remain up-to-date with the actual files on the hard drive.</li><br>  <li> Break down your workflow into distinct tasks: import, edit, Develop, export, etc. Following a consistent sequence of steps will make your work go much quicker.</li><br>  <li> Lightroom provides loads of time-saving features to automate and speed up your workflow. Most important are presets and templates. Generally speaking, presets store settings and templates store formatted layouts. Get in the habit of setting up your own presets and templates for any settings that you will use frequently.</li><br>  <li> Be sure to make frequent backups of your Lightroom catalog and image files; ideally, after every work session. (You will most likely only need to keep the most recent couple of catalog backups.)</li></ul></p>    <p>  <ul>  <strong>Top 5 tips if you\x92ve been using Lightroom for a while</strong>  <br><br>  <li> The Import process has been entirely revamped and streamlined in Lightroom 3. The new Import window provides more functionality and is easier to navigate. Maybe most importantly, you can now save Import presets! If you perform many imports using the same settings, this will dramatically speed up your import workflow.</li><br>  <li> The processing in Lightroom 3 is built around a new Process Version, which offers notably better image quality and speed when working with your photos. New photos imported into Lightroom 3 will automatically use the new Process Version (2010). Photos already in the catalog will retain their original Process Version (2003). You can update older photos to use the new Process Version, which will allow you to extract even better quality from those photos. After updating photos to the new Process Version you will likely need to go back and fine tune the Develop settings for those files (especially sharpening).</li><br>  <li> Lightroom 3 offers new and improved sharpening algorithms with a greater degree of control. One important point to note is that the Amount adjustment generally applies stronger sharpening than in previous versions, so now, you probably will use lower values for Amount.</li><br>  <li> Lightroom 3\x92s updated Noise Reduction (NR) controls are also vastly improved over previous versions; so much that you may no longer need any specialized NR software for the majority of your photos. Luminance noise reduction, in particular, lets you apply much stronger reduction amounts without adversely affecting important image detail.</li><br>  <li> If you\x92ve saved Develop presets using adjustments for sharpening, noise reduction and vignetting you should revisit those settings and consider making a new preset based on the changes in the new Process Version.</li></ul></p>    <p>  <strong> Before & After Examples</strong><br><br>      <table cellspacing="20" align="center"> <tr>    <td><div align="center">   <table align="center" bgcolor="#fffff" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2">   <tbody><tr>    <td align="center"><img src="http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/books/orly/coalson_lr3_example_1._V199854880_.png" align="center" border="0"></td>   </tr> <tr>    <td><left><font size="1">Example 1.

John Avlon explains how hate-fueled rumors take hold (one section is called \x93How Obama Became Hitler, a Communist and the Antichrist\x94), looks at the \x91hunt for heretics\x92 that is taking place inside both parties and details the rise of hyper-partisan media.

Harris offers a vivid historical tour of mankind\'s willingness to suspend reason in favor of religious beliefs, even when those beliefs are used to justify harmful behavior and sometimes-heinous crimes. He asserts that in the shadow of weapons of mass destruction, we can no longer tolerate views that pit one true god against another. Most controversially, he argues that we cannot afford moderate lip service to religion; an accommodation that only blinds us to the real perils of fundamentalism. While warning against the encroachment of organized religion into world politics, Harris also draws on new evidence from neuroscience and insights from philosophy to explore spirituality as a biological, brain-based need. He calls on us to invoke that need in taking a secular humanistic approach to solving the problems of this world.'

(S'Reasonable Faith: Christian Truth and Apologetics'
p3376
S'<p><em>Perfect as a textbook yet excellent for lay readers, this  updated edition builds a positive case for Christianity by applying  the latest thought to core theological themes.</em></p>  <p>J. Gresham Machen once said, "False ideas are the greatest  obstacles to the reception of the gospel"-which makes apologetics  that much more important. Wanting to engage not just academics and  pastors but Christian laypeople and seekers, William Lane Craig has  revised and updated key sections in this third edition of his  classic text to reflect the latest work in astrophysics,  philosophy, probability calculus, the arguments for the existence  of God, and Reformed epistemology.</p>  <p>His approach-that of positive apologetics-gives careful  attention to crucial questions and concerns, including: the  relationship of faith and reason, the existence of God, the  problems of historical knowledge and miracles, the personal claims  of Christ, and the historicity of the resurrection of Jesus. He  shows that there is good reason to think Christianity is true. As  Craig says, "If you have a sound and persuasive case for  Christianity, you don\'t have to become an expert in comparative  religions and Christian cults. A positive justification of the  Christian faith automatically overwhelms all competing world views  lacking an equally strong case."</p>'

(S'A Failure of Nerve: Leadership in the Age of the Quick Fix'
p3386
S'  Ten years after his death, Edwin Friedman\'s insights into leadership are   more urgently needed than ever.  He was the first to tell us that all   organizations have personalities, like families, and to apply the insights   of family therapy to churches and synagogues, rectors and rabbis,   politicians and teachers.<br> <i>Failure of Nerve</i> is essential reading   for all leaders, be they parents or presidents, corporate executives or   educators, religious superiors or coaches, healers or generals, managers or   clergy.<P>     Friedman\'s insights about our regressed, "seatbelt society," oriented   toward safety rather than adventure, help explain the sabotage that leaders   constantly face today. Suspicious of the "quick fixes" and instant   solutions that sweep through our culture only to give way to the next fad,   he argues for strength and self-differentiation as the marks of true   leadership. His formula for success is more maturity, not more data;   stamina, not technique; and personal responsibility, not empathy.<P>      This book was unfinished at the time of Friedman\'s death, and originally   published in a limited edition. This new edition makes his life-changing   insights and challenges to a new generation of readers.<P>'

Now Hannah once again reveals the fragile ties that bind a family in transition, as two people choose to escape the limits of their ordinary lives and reach for the extraordinary promise that lies on <i>Distant Shores</i>.<br><br>Elizabeth and Jackson Shore married young, raised two daughters, and weathered the storms of youth as they built a future together. But after the children leave home, they quietly drift apart. When Jack accepts a wonderful new job offer, Elizabeth puts her needs aside to follow him across the country. Until the sudden death of her father changes everything.<br><br>Grieving and alone, she retreats to an isolated beach house where she packs away the last remnants of her parents\x92 lives. There, the pieces of a past she never knew unfold to reveal a tender story of lasting devotion, the kind of steadfast commitment that Elizabeth admits is missing from her own marriage. Faced with her own disillusionment, she makes a terrifying decision, risking everything she has for a second chance at happiness. <br><br>Enriched by soul-stirring emotion and an appreciation for the simple joy of everyday miracles, <i>Distant Shores</i> is an exquisite reminder of the most precious gifts in life: friends and family, children and lovers, the strength to change, and the courage to forgive\x96all flawlessly captured by the graceful hands of Kristin Hannah.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

For many tea partiers nationwide, nullification is rapidly becoming the only way to stop an over-reaching government drunk on power. From privacy to national healthcare, Woods shows how this growing and popular movement is sweeping across America and empowering states to take action against Obama\'s socialist policies and big-government agenda.'

S'John Corey and Asad Khalil have both lived hard-knock lives. As revealed in Nelson DeMille\'s monster bestseller Plum Island, the gruff, wisecracking NYPD homicide cop Corey stopped a hail of bullets--but he couldn\'t stop his wife from walking out on him. Asad, raised under Muammar Qaddafi\'s eye after his dad\'s murder, lost his surviving family in the 1986 bombing of Libya. He\'s heard the nasty rumors about his mom and the colonel, but he aims his rage at the infidels. The boy\'s got such a gift for terrorism he\'s earned the nickname "the Lion," and Boris, his vodka-sozzled, sex-addicted +\xacmigr+\xac mentor, knows precisely how to conduct a murder tour of America one step ahead of the police, the FBI, the CIA, and the ATTF (Anti-Terrorist Task Force), which combines members of all three. A pity Boris must die, but hey, he\'s an infidel too.Asad pretends to defect, handcuffed to agents aboard a 747 bound for JFK, and he proves to be a worse seatmate than a siding salesman. Corey and his ATTF colleagues (most conspicuously the FBI\'s sexy Kate Mayfield, Corey\'s match in badinage and bad-guy busting) strive to halt Asad\'s methodical yet unpredictable bloodbath. Skillfully, DeMille alternates chapters told from Asad\'s and Corey\'s points of view. DeMille did his authenticity homework: when we\'re not savoring his gift for wiseacre dialogue in the Corey-Kate chapters, we\'re sweating alongside Asad on his ghastly, ingenious jihad. The New York Times put DeMille\'s social satire on a par with Edith Wharton\'s, and he\'s great on the colliding folkways of the feuding, mutually doublecrossing crimebuster institutions. Naturally, he\'s on the side of the regular-guy flatfoots. "Cops sit on their asses and flip through their folders," he writes. "Feds sit on their derrieres and peruse their dossiers." And the CIA gets it in the shorts, satirically speaking. One deplores the mass murderers, but the book\'s real bad guys wear the priciest suits.DeMille reportedly has a $25 million book contract. With fast, funny, absorbing thrillers like The Lion\'s Game, he\'s earned it. --Tim Appelo'

S'Of all things Catholic, there is nothing that is so familiar us the Mass. With its unchanging prayers, the Mass fits Catholics like their favorite clothes. Yet most Catholics sitting in the pews on Sundays fail to see the powerful supernatural drama that enfolds them. Pope John Paul II described the Mass as "heaven on Earth," explaining that what "we celebrate on Earth is a mysterious participation in the heavenly liturgy."'

(S'Steinbrenner: The Last Lion of Baseball'
p3516
S'<p> No owner has changed the landscape of sports more than New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner. From the moment he bought the team in 1973 for $10 million, Steinbrenner\'s monomaniacal pursuit was to restore the most fabled franchise in baseball history to its former glory. Today the New York Yankees are worth more than $1 billion and are once again world champions. </p> <p> Award-winning sportswriter Bill Madden traces Steinbrenner from his early days in Cleveland through his years as a shipping magnate, a Nixon fund-raiser, and a champion horse breeder to the fateful moment when he bought the Yankees, even though his father disparaged George\'s desire to own a professional sports team as a "hobby." Over the next four decades, Steinbrenner\'s tumultuous reign included his epic battles with Billy Martin, Reggie Jackson, Dave Winfield, even beloved Yankee captain Derek Jeter. His ruthless and free-spending tactics made him a lightning rod for controversy but they also paid off: Steinbrenner\'s Yankees have won seven championships and remain the gold standard in all sports. In the last few years, with his health declining, the Boss ceded control of the team to his sons, but not before lording over the team\'s historic transition from the House That Ruth Built to the House That George Built. </p> <p> Throughout his three decades of covering the Yankees, Bill Madden has cultivated hundreds of sources at every level in the organization, from the many managers and front-office personnel Steinbrenner has fired to the bat boys who are ever present in the locker room. All of them have colorful stories about the man with whom they have enjoyed a love-hate relationship, but it is the Boss himself whose voice rises above the rest. And when Steinbrenner decided to give his final print interview, he spoke to Madden to set the record straight on his extraordinary life and career. </p>'

S"Trudy Harris began her career with Hospice in 1981, eventually becoming the president of the Hospice Foundation for Caring. This collection of more than forty true stories of Harris's patients offers readers an incredible glimpse at what lies beyond and what the living can learn from the dying. Her patients have described to her visions of angels and loved ones who have gone on before, the sounds of ethereal music, colors that did not exist on earth. She has been with hundreds of patients as they took their last breaths and knows the kinds of questions that both the dying and the loved ones they are leaving behind ask.     \x95 What do you say to a loved one who is dying?      \x95 What happens when we die?      \x95 How can you make a dying friend feel safe?      \x95 Does a dying person really see angels, hear music, or see friends and family members who have already died?

p3586
S'<b>Be Transformed by Christ\x92s Example</b>  <br><br>\x93God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.\x94 \x971 Peter 5:5  <br><br>A battle rages within every one of us every day. It\x92s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God\x92s call to recognize that we\x92re really nothing without Him. It\x92s pride versus humility. And it\x92s a fight we can\x92t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His thorough examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God\x92s abundant favor. <br><br>\x93This is the one to whom I will look:  <br><br>he who is humble and contrite in spirit.\x94  <br><br>\x97Isaiah 66:2, esv  <br><br>God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He\x92s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated.  <br><br>Which will you pursue?  <br><br>C. J. Mahaney paints a striking picture of the daily battle quietly raging within every Christian and asks whether you will passively accommodate the enemy of your soul, pride, or actively cultivate your best friend, humility. When you acknowledge the deception of pride and intentionally humble yourself, you become free to savor abundant mercies and unlikely graces. You will find a new life is yours\x97a life God richly favors. A God-glorifying life you don\x92t want to miss.  <br><br>\x93C. J. Mahaney is not humble. At least, that\x92s what he\x92ll tell you. And that\x92s one reason he\x92s so well qualified to write this book.\x94  <br><br>Mark E. Dever  <br><br>Senior pastor, Capitol Hill Baptist Church  <br><br>Author, <i>Nine Marks of a Healthy Church</i>  <br><br><i>\x93A much-needed wake-up call on this important subject.

Albert Mohler, Jr.  <br><br>President, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary <br><br><b>Story Behind the Book</b><br><br>\x93Given pride\x92s pervasive presence in my life, I come to this book in holy fear, yet inspired by God\x92s promises to be humble and sobered by his warnings to the proud (Isaiah 66:2b, 1 Peter 5:5b). Scripture reveals to us that, while pride was the first and most serious sin, God is decisively drawn to humility and is specifically supportive of the humble. Only Christ has fully obeyed Isaiah 66:2b (\x93This is the one I esteem: he who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word\x94), yet He did so as our representative! How marvelous that in our daily battle against pride we can rely on God\x92s grace, through the gospel, and thus bring honor and glory to God.\x94 \x97C. J. Mahaney'

(S"Justification: God's Plan & Paul's Vision"
p3591
S"Few issues are more central to the Christian faith than the nature, scope and means of salvation. Many have thought it to be largely a transaction that gets one to heaven. In this riveting book, N. T. Wright explains that God's salvation is radically more than this.    <P>At the heart of much vigorous debate on this topic is the term the apostle Paul uses in several of his letters to describe what happens to those in Christ--justification. Paul uses this dramatic image from the law court to declare that Christians are acquitted of the cosmic accusations against them. But justification goes beyond this in Paul's writings to offer a vision of God's future for the whole world as well as for his people.    <P>Here in one place Wright now offers a comprehensive account and defense of his perspective on this crucial doctrine. He provides a sweeping overview of the central points in the debate before launching into a thorough explanation of the key texts in Paul's writings. While fully cognizant of tradition and controversy, the final authority for his conclusions is the letters of Paul themselves.    <P>Along the way Wright responds to critics, such as John Piper, who have challenged what has come to be called the New Perspective. For Wright, what Paul means by justification is nothing less than God's unswerving commitment to the covenant promise he made to bless the whole world through Abraham and his family.    <P>This irenic response is an important contribution for those on both sides of the debate--and those still in between--to consider. Whether you're a fan of Wright's work or have read his critics and would like to know the other side of the story, here is a chance to interact with Wright's views on the issues at stake and form your own conclusions."

p3621
S'In 2007,<i> Time</i> magazine named him one of the most influential novelists in the world. He has twice been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize.<i> The New York Times Book Review</i> called him simply \x93a genius.\x94 Now David Mitchell lends fresh credence to <i>The Guardian</i>\x92s claim that \x93each of his books seems entirely different from that which preceded it.\x94 <b>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</b> is a stunning departure for this brilliant, restless, and wildly ambitious author, a giant leap forward by even his own high standards. A bold and epic novel of a rarely visited point in history, it is a work as exquisitely rendered as it is irresistibly readable.<br><br>The year is 1799, the place Dejima in Nagasaki Harbor, the \x93high-walled, fan-shaped artificial island\x94 that is the Japanese Empire\x92s single port and sole window onto the world, designed to keep the West at bay; the farthest outpost of the war-ravaged Dutch East Indies Company; and a de facto prison for the dozen foreigners permitted to live and work there. To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, costly courtesans, earthquakes, and typhoons comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout and resourceful young clerk who has five years in the East to earn a fortune of sufficient size to win the hand of his wealthy fianc\xe9e back in Holland.<br><br>But Jacob\x92s original intentions are eclipsed after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor and midwife to the city\x92s powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully broken. The consequences will extend beyond Jacob\x92s worst imaginings.\xa0 As one cynical colleague asks, \x93Who ain\x92t a gambler in the glorious Orient, with his very life?\x94<br><br>A magnificent mix of luminous writing, prodigious research, and heedless imagination, <b>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</b> is the most impressive achievement of its eminent author.'

The problem is, restaurant chains and food producers aren't interested in helping you make healthy choices. In fact, they invest $30 billion a year on advertising, much of it aimed at confusing eaters and disguising the fat and calorie counts of their products.</DIV><DIV>\xa0</DIV><DIV>Thankfully <I>Eat This, Not That! Restaurant Survival Guide</I> is here to help. It\x92s the first book in the <I>Eat This, Not That!</I> series to focus solely on burger shacks, pizza parlors, pasta joints, breakfast diners, Mexican cantinas, Chinese eateries, drive-thrus, and coffee shops. With in-depth coverage of 80 of the biggest restaurant chains in the country, it arms you with the information you need to take control of your diet and sidestep the egregious calorie-landmines that are secretly sabotaging your chances of losing weight.

S'Fifteen years after its first publication, <i>The Second Shift</i> remains just as important and relevant today as it did then. As the majority of women entered the workforce, sociologist and Berkeley professor Arlie Hochschild was one of the first to talk about what really happens in dual-career households. Many people were amazed to find that women still did the majority of childcare and housework even though they also worked outside the home. Now, in this updated edition with a new introduction from the author, we discover how much things have, or have not, changed for women today.'

It is one of the fastest growing companies in history, an essential part of the social life not only of teenagers but hundreds of millions of adults worldwide. As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects\x97even becoming instrumental in political protests from Colombia to Iran. <P>Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook\x92s key executives in researching this fascinating history of the company and its impact on our lives. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company\x92s remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else. <P>How did a nineteen-year-old Harvard student create a company that has transformed the Internet and how did he grow it to its current enormous size? Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg steadfastly refused to compromise his vision, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, altering politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity.

Although Bennie and Sasha never discover each other\x92s pasts, the reader does, in intimate detail, along with the secret lives of a host of other characters whose paths intersect with theirs, over many years, in locales as varied as New York, San Francisco, Naples, and Africa.<br><br>We first meet Sasha in her mid-thirties, on her therapist\x92s couch in New York City, confronting her long-standing compulsion to steal. Later, we learn the genesis of her turmoil when we see her as the child of a violent marriage, then as a runaway living in Naples, then as a college student trying to avert the suicidal impulses of her best friend. We plunge into the hidden yearnings and disappointments of her uncle, an art historian stuck in a dead marriage, who travels to Naples to extract Sasha from the city\x92s demimonde and experiences an epiphany of his own while staring at a sculpture of Orpheus and Eurydice in the Museo Nazionale. We meet Bennie Salazar at the melancholy nadir of his adult life\x97divorced, struggling to connect with his nine-year-old son, listening to a washed-up band in the basement of a suburban house\x97and then revisit him in 1979, at the height of his youth, shy and tender, reveling in San Francisco\x92s punk scene as he discovers his ardor for rock and roll and his gift for spotting talent. We learn what became of his high school gang\x97who thrived and who faltered\x97and we encounter Lou Kline, Bennie\x92s catastrophically careless mentor, along with the lovers and children left behind in the wake of Lou\x92s far-flung sexual conquests and meteoric rise and fall.<br><i><br>A Visit from the Goon Squad</i> is a book about the interplay of time and music, about survival, about the stirrings and transformations set inexorably in motion by even the most passing conjunction of our fates.

(S'The Divine Conspiracy: Rediscovering Our Hidden Life In God'
p3800
S'A renowned teacher and writer of the acclaimed <I>The Spirit of the Disciplines, </I>Dallas Willard, one of today\'s most brilliant Christian thinkers now offers a timely and challenging call back to the true meaning of Christian discipleship. In <I>The Divine Conspiracy, </I>Willard gracefully weaves biblical teaching, popular culture, science, scholarship, and spiritual practice into a tour de force that shows the necessity of profound changes in how we view our lives and faith. In an era when many Christians consider Jesus a beloved but remote savior, Willard argues compellingly for the relevance of God to every aspect of our existence. Masterfully capturing the central insights of Christ\'s teachings in a fresh way for today\'s seekers, he helps us to explore a revolutionary way to experience God--by knowing Him as an essential part of the here and now, rather than only as a part of the hereafter.<P>"The most telling thing about the contemporary Christian," Willard writes, "is that he or she has no compelling sense that understanding of and conformity with the clear teachings of Christ is of any vital importance to [their] life, and certainly not that it is in any way essential . . . Such obedience is regarded as just out of the question or impossible." Christians, he says, for the most part consider the primary function of Christianity to be admittance to heaven. But, as Willard clearly shows, a faith that guarantees a satisfactory afterlife, yet has absolutely no impact on life in the here and now, is nothing more than "consumer Christianity" and "bumper-sticker faith."<P>Willard refutes this "fire escape" mentality by exploring the true nature of the teachings of Jesus, who intended that His followers become His disciples, and taught that we have access <I>now</I> to the life we are only too eager to relegate to the hereafter. The author calls us into a more authentic faith and offers a practical plan by which we can become Christ-like. He challenges us to step aside from the politics and pieties of contemporary Christian practice and inspires us to reject the all too common lukewarm faith of our times by embracing the true meaning of Christian discipleship.</p><P><B>A Powerful, Thought-Provoking <BR>Guide to Living the Life <BR>Jesus Intends for Us</B></p> "My hope is to gain a fresh hearing for Jesus, especially among those who believe they already understand him. Very few people today find Jesus interesting as a person or of vital relevance to the course of their actual lives. He is not generally regarded as a real life personality who deals with real-life issues, but is thought to be concerned with some feathery realm other than the one we must <I>deal</I> with, and must deal with <I>now."</I><P>"[A]ctual discipleship or apprenticeship to Jesus is, in our day, no longer thought of as in any way essential to faith in him. It is regarded as a costly option, a spiritual luxury, or possibly even as an evasion. Why bother with discipleship, it is widely thought, or, for that matter, with a conversational relationship with God? Let us get on with what we have to <I>do."</I></p><P>"This book, then, presents discipleship to Jesus as the very heart of the gospel. The eternal life that begins with confidence in Jesus is a life in His present kingdom, now on earth and available to all. So the message of and about him is specifically a gospel for our life now, not just for dying. It is about living now as his apprentice in kingdom living, not just as a consumer of his merits. Our future, however far we look, is a natural extension of the faith by which we live now and the life in which we now participate."</p><P>-- from The Divine Conspiracy</P>'

And he makes everyone else around him feel like smiling. He\'s the Dalai Lama, the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, a Nobel Prize winner, and a hugely sought-after speaker and statesman. Why is he so popular? Even after spending only a few minutes in his presence you can\'t help feeling happier.<BR><BR> If you ask him if he\'s happy, even though he\'s suffered the loss of his country, the Dalai Lama will give you an unconditional yes. What\'s more, he\'ll tell you that happiness is the purpose of life, and that "the very motion of our life is toward happiness." How to get there has always been the question. He\'s tried to answer it before, but he\'s never had the help of a psychiatrist to get the message across in a context we can easily understand.<BR><BR> <I>The Art of Happiness</I> is the book that started the genre of happiness books, and it remains the cornerstone of the field of positive psychology.<BR><BR> Through conversations, stories, and meditations, the Dalai Lama shows us how to defeat day-to-day anxiety, insecurity, anger, and discouragement. Together with Dr. Howard Cutler, he explores many facets of everyday life, including relationships, loss, and the pursuit of wealth, to illustrate how to ride through life\'s obstacles on a deep and abiding source of inner peace. Based on 2,500 years of Buddhist meditations mixed with a healthy dose of common sense, <I>The Art of Happiness</I> is a book that crosses the boundaries of traditions to help readers with difficulties common to all human beings. After being in print for ten years, this book has touched countless lives and uplifted spirits around the world.'

p3825
S'Jon Krakauer\x92s literary reputation rests on insightful chronicles of lives conducted at the outer limits. He now shifts his focus from extremes of physical adventure to extremes of religious belief within our own borders, taking readers inside isolated American communities where some 40,000 Mormon Fundamentalists still practice polygamy. Defying both civil authorities and the Mormon establishment in Salt Lake City, the renegade leaders of these Taliban-like theocracies are zealots who answer only to God.<br><br>At the core of Krakauer\x92s book are brothers Ron and Dan Lafferty, who insist they received a commandment from God to kill a blameless woman and her baby girl. Beginning with a meticulously researched account of this appalling double murder, Krakauer constructs a multi-layered, bone-chilling narrative of messianic delusion, polygamy, savage violence, and unyielding faith. Along the way he uncovers a shadowy offshoot of America\x92s fastest growing religion, and raises provocative questions about the nature of religious belief.'

In addition to groundbreaking analysis of fear-and-fold equity and equilibrium, plus the presentation of optimal strategies for the bubble, the end-game, and heads-up play, this second edition adds 50 pages of incisive commentary from the hottest tournament-poker-player in the world, Bertrand 'Elky' Grospellier, and a new chapter on short-stack cash games to go with the original discussion of playing in short-handed cash games. With a Foreword by 2006 World Series of Poker champion Joe Hachem, annotations by Elky, and solid math-based strategies from Lee Nelson, Tysen Streib, Steven Heston, and Mark Vos, Kill Everyone packs more poker brainpower between two covers than any book to come before it."

(S'The Youth Pill: Scientists at the Brink of an Anti-Aging Revolution'
p3839
S'"After watching elderly mice on resveratrol perform like rodent Olympians in an endurance test, I came away convinced that the long, weird quest to extend life span-a 5,000-year trek during which hopelessly hopeful seekers tried everything from transfusing youths\' blood into their aged veins to injecting minced dog testicles-was finally getting somewhere." <BR><BR> Even before the first person set off to find the Fountain of Youth, we\'ve been searching for a way to live longer. But promises of life extension have long reeked of snake oil, and despite our wishful thinking-not to mention the number of vitamins we pop, cups of ginkgo tea we drink, or miles we jog-few of us believe we\'ll live to see 100, much less set a longevity record. <BR><BR> Scientists, too, have long been skeptical, often dismissing gerontology, the study of aging, as little more than a front for charlatans. And it\'s hard to blame them. Aging\'s daunting complexity has often led to more questions than answers, and opportunists have always been quick to cash in on any development, no matter how dubious. <BR><BR> But now we\'re closing in on true breakthroughs in anti-aging science. Compounds that dramatically extend the health spans and longevity of animals, including mammals, have recently been demonstrated in the lab, and gerontologists now generally agree that drugs that slow human aging and greatly boost health in later life are no longer a distant dream-in fact, candidates supported by reams of data are already at hand. <BR><BR> David Stipp, a veteran science journalist, tells the story of these momentous developments and the scientists behind them. He reveals how seemingly unconnected findings on gene mutations that can double animals\' life spans, the life-extending effect of near-starvation diets, the link between dwarfism and longevity, the secrets of weirdly long-lived animals, and the special genes behind human centenarians\' radical resistance to the ravages of time are coming together to spark an anti-aging revolution. <BR><BR> Writing for nonscientists, Stipp provides a definitive, engaging account of some of the most exciting, and sometimes controversial, advances that promise to change the way we live forever.'

S'Vijay Singh, Masters and PGA Champion, says, "ZEN GOLF is the best  book there is for connecting golf and the mind together. It\'s for  everyone, and you\'re going to enjoy it. I keep it in my golf bag and  take it with me everywhere." Charles Howell III says, "The techniques  in ZEN GOLF for working with negative thoughts are better than any  other psychological approach." In chapters such as "Never Keep More  Than a Hundred Thoughts in Your Mind During Your Swing", "Isn\'t Where  You Have to Play It From Punishment Enough?" and "How to Enjoy a Bad  Round of Golf", the Dr. Joe Parent, a PGA TOUR Instructor, guides  golfers with simple yet powerful techniques to prepare for, execute,  and, equally important, respond to the results of any golf shot. The  author draws on his teaching experience and sense of humor to offer  special methods that have led to amazing improvements in the games of  professionals and amateurs alike. By applying classic insights and  stories from the Buddhist tradition to the challenges of golf, ZEN  GOLF shows you how to make your mind an ally instead of an enemy: how  to stay calm, clear the interference that leads to poor shots, and  eliminate bad habits and mental mistakes.    Clear, concise, and enlightening, this book introduces a unique  perspective combining modern psychology, Buddhist wisdom and  professional golf instruction. Zen Golf shapes ancient philosophies  into new teachings, leading golfers to the effortless focus and  unconditional confidence of being in "the zone."      '

p3879
S"  As Christians, we believe that all sins are considered equal in God's eyes.   Yet while evangelicals continue to decry the Big Ones--such as abortion,   adultery, and violence--we often overlook more deceptive sins.    <P>It seems we have created a sliding scale where gossip, jealousy, and   selfishness comfortably exist within the church. In short, some sins have   simply become acceptable.    <P>Acclaimed author Jerry Bridges believes that just as culture has lost the   concept of sin, the church faces the same danger. Jerry writes not from a   sense of achievement, but from the trenches of his own personal battles.   Drawing from scriptural truth, he sheds light on subtle behaviors that can   derail our spiritual growth.     <P>Throughout, Jerry encourages victory over personal sin through the gospel's   transforming power. This release is perfect for readers who long to   thoughtfully examine their lives and discover a deeper walk with God."

Cold War veteran and CIA Operations Director Thomas Stansfield knows he must prepare his people for the next war. The rise of Islamic terrorism is coming, and it needs to be met abroad before it reaches America\x92s shores. Stansfield directs his prot\xc9g\xc9e, Irene Kennedy, and his old Cold War colleague, Stan Hurley, to form a new group of clandestine operatives who will work outside the normal chain of command\x97men who do not exist.<P>What type of man is willing to kill for his country without putting on a uniform? Kennedy finds him in the wake of the Pan Am Lockerbie terrorist attack. Two-hundred and seventy souls perished that cold December night, and thousands of family and friends were left searching for comfort. Mitch Rapp was one of them, but he was not interested in comfort. He wanted retribution.<P>Six months of intense training has prepared him to bring the war to the enemy\x92s doorstep, and he does so with brutal efficiency. Rapp starts in Istanbul, where he assassinates the Turkish arms dealer who sold the explosives used in the Pan Am attack. Rapp then moves onto Hamburg with his team and across Europe, leaving a trail of bodies. All roads lead to Beirut, though, and what Rapp doesn\x92t know is that the enemy is aware of his existence and has prepared a trap. The hunter is about to become the hunted, and Rapp will need every ounce of skill and cunning if he is to survive the war-ravaged city and its various terrorist factions.<P>As action-packed, fast-paced, and brutally realistic as it gets, Flynn\x92s latest page-turner shows readers how it all began.

(S'Eat This Not That! The Best (& Worst!) Foods in America!: The No-Diet Weight Loss Solution'
p3929
S"Did you know that choosing one fast-food milk shake over another can save you 2,000 calories? That's right. The difference is an entire day's worth of calories. Make a swap like that once a week and you'll save nearly 30 pounds in one year. And that's just the beginning.  <p>  Eat This Not That! The Best (& Worst!) Foods in America! is the culmination of years of dedicated food-industry coverage. It\x92s also the most comprehensive list of the country\x92s most dangerous food items \x96 the burgers, salads, pizzas, and beers that can single handedly sabotage an otherwise healthy diet. Do you know which popular restaurant is selling a cocktail with nearly 900 calories? How about the cafe that sells a doughnut with more sugar than two candy bars? Read this book and you\x92ll discover the food industry\x92s biggest secrets, and you\x92ll never approach a restaurant menu the same way again.  <p>  Within the pages of this book you\x92ll find chapters dedicated to America\x92s best and worst breakfasts, burgers, pizzas, and supermarket foods, as well as best and worst foods for fighting sickness, battling high blood pressure and cholesterol, and keeping blood sugar in check. But as with the other installments of Eat This, Not That!, you\x92ll  also find a cache of life-changing guides, helping you to:  <ul>  <li>Understand the additives in the foods you eat. (Just what is MSG, and how dangerous is it, really?)  <li>Identify the \x93healthy\x94 foods that are secretly packing your body with excess calories, fat, sugar, and sodium (At one restaurant, you\x92re better off eating the ribs than the turkey burger!)  <li>Navigate the mall\x92s food court. (Save 55 grams of fat by eating an Auntie Anne\x92s pretzel!)  <li>Score big in the drive-thru (Cut a thousand calories from your Hardee\x92s Thickburger!)  </ul>"

S'James Lee Burke\x92s eagerly awaited new novel finds Detective Dave Robicheaux back in New Iberia, Louisiana, and embroiled in the most harrowing and dangerous case of his career. Seven young women in neighboring Jefferson Davis Parish have been brutally murdered. While the crimes have all the telltale signs of a serial killer, the death of Bernadette Latiolais, a high school honor student, doesn\x92t fit: she is not the kind of hapless and marginalized victim psychopaths usually prey upon. Robicheaux and his best friend, Clete Purcel, confront Herman Stanga, a notorious pimp and crack dealer whom both men despise. When Stanga turns up dead shortly after a fierce beating by Purcel, in front of numerous witnesses, the case takes a nasty turn, and Clete\x92s career and life are hanging by threads over the abyss. <P><P>Adding to Robicheaux\x92s troubles is the matter of his daughter, Alafair, on leave from Stanford Law to put the finishing touches on her novel. Her literary pursuit has led her into the arms of Kermit Abelard, celebrated novelist and scion of a once prominent Louisiana family whose fortunes are slowly sinking into the corruption of Louisiana\x92s subculture. Abelard\x92s association with bestselling ex-convict author Robert Weingart, a man who uses and discards people like Kleenex, causes Robicheaux to fear that Alafair might be destroyed by the man she loves. As his daughter seems to drift away from him, he wonders if he has become a victim of his own paranoia. But as usual, Robicheaux\x92s instincts are proven correct and he finds himself dealing with a level of evil that is greater than any enemy he has confronted in the past. <P><P>Set against the backdrop of an Edenic paradise threatened by pernicious forces, James Lee Burke\x92s <I>The Glass Rainbow </I>is already being hailed as perhaps the best novel in the Robicheaux series.'

S'**Based on reviews, the authors are adding this preface: "This is NOT a how-to or a recipe book for the HCG Diet, and was never purported to be.  The Pocket Guide to the HCG Protocol was created and made available in response of many customer requests for a small book to carry in their purse for convenience, especially during Phase 3 (the maintenance phase) of the HCG Diet.   Those customers particularly wanted the chart of 1,000 foods, drinks, and condiments charting whether or not each item is allowed, cautioned, or not allowed on each phase of the protocol that was easy to carry around for eating out and grocery shopping purposes.  So, that is why this book is for sale and that is what its purpose is in your HCG Diet Library." ** This is the description of the book:   If you don\'t want to lug the "HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide" around throughout your day, this compact book is a great addition to your protocol library. The Pocket Guide to the HCG Protocol is a very, very short summary of the HCG Diet Protocol in purse/pocket size purely for convenience. This little book packs the basic information including: a summary of a typical round of the HCG protocol, Dr. Simeons\' list of approved foods for the protocol, rules for the maintenance phase, and a nutrition chart of 1,000 foods, drinks, and condiments charting whether or not each item is allowed, cautioned, or not allowed on each phase of the protocol.  This small, summary book was created solely out of customer demand for a more compact resource to carry around. ALL information is extracted from The HCG Weight Loss Cure Guide to provide a convenient, carry-along version.'

It takes the kitchen memoir to a rough and reckless place. <BR><BR>From his first job scraping trays at a pizzeria at age fifteen, Jason Sheehan worked on the line at all kinds of restaurants: a French colonial and an all-night diner, a crab shack just off the interstate and a fusion restaurant in a former hair salon. Restaurant work, as he describes it in exuberant, sparkling prose, is a way of life in which \x93your whole universe becomes a small, hot steel box filled with knives and meat and fire.\x94 The kitchen crew is a fraternity with its own rites: cigarettes in the walk-in freezer, sex in the basement, the wartime urgency of the dinner rush. Cooking is a series of personal challenges, from the first perfectly done mussel to the satisfaction of surgically sliced foie gras. And the kitchen itself, as he tells it, is a place in which life\x92s mysteries are thawed, sliced, broiled, barbecued, and fried\x97a place where people from the margins find their community and their calling. <BR><BR>With this deeply affecting book, Sheehan (already acclaimed for his reviews) joins the first class of American food writers at a time when books about food have never been better or more popular. </P><P></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>'

Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves is the answer to this universal wish.

(S"The Omnivore's Dilemma: A Natural History of Four Meals"
p4072
S'The bestselling author of <i>The Botany of Desire</i> explores the ecology of eating to unveil why we consume what we consume in the twenty-first century  <br><br>  "What should we have for dinner?" To one degree or another this simple question assails any creature faced with a wide choice of things to eat. Anthropologists call it the omnivore\'s dilemma. Choosing from among the countless potential foods nature offers, humans have had to learn what is safe, and what isn\'t-which mushrooms should be avoided, for example, and which berries we can enjoy. Today, as America confronts what can only be described as a national eating disorder, the omnivore\'s dilemma has returned with an atavistic vengeance. The cornucopia of the modern American supermarket and fast-food outlet has thrown us back on a bewildering landscape where we once again have to worry about which of those tasty-looking morsels might kill us. At the same time we\'re realizing that our food choices also have profound implications for the health of our environment. <i>The Omnivore\'s Dilemma</i> is bestselling author Michael Pollan\'s brilliant and eye-opening exploration of these little-known but vitally important dimensions of eating in America.  <br><br>  Pollan has divided <i>The Omnivore\'s Dilemma</i> into three parts, one for each of the food chains that sustain us: industrialized food, alternative or "organic" food, and food people obtain by dint of their own hunting, gathering, or gardening. Pollan follows each food chain literally from the ground up to the table, emphasizing our dynamic coevolutionary relationship with the species we depend on. He concludes each section by sitting down to a meal--at McDonald\'s, at home with his family sharing a dinner from Whole Foods, and in a revolutionary "beyond organic" farm in Virginia. For each meal he traces the provenance of everything consumed, revealing the hidden components we unwittingly ingest and explaining how our taste for particular foods reflects our environmental and biological inheritance.  <br><br>  We are indeed what we eat-and what we eat remakes the world. A society of voracious and increasingly confused omnivores, we are just beginning to recognize the profound consequences of the simplest everyday food choices, both for ourselves and for the natural world. <i>The Omnivore\'s Dilemma</i> is a long-overdue book and one that will become known for bringing a completely fresh perspective to a question as ordinary and yet momentous as What shall we have for dinner?'

p4110
S'How do we make decisions--good and bad--and why are some people so much better at it than others? Thats the question Malcolm Gladwell asks and answers in the follow-up to his huge bestseller, The Tipping Point. Utilizing case studies as diverse as speed dating, pop music, and the shooting of Amadou Diallo, Gladwell reveals that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more complicated than assumed. Drawing on cutting-edge neuroscience and psychology, he shows how the difference between good decision-making and bad has nothing to do with how much information we can process quickly, but on the few particular details on which we focus. Leaping boldly from example to example, displaying all of the brilliance that made The Tipping Point a classic, Gladwell reveals how we can become better decision makers--in our homes, our offices, and in everyday life. The result is a book that is surprising and transforming. Never again will you think about thinking the same way.'

S'"I believe there is another man inside every man, a stranger . . ." writes Wilfred Leland James in the early pages of the riveting confession that makes up "1922," the first in this pitch-black quartet of mesmerizing tales from Stephen King. For James, that stranger is awakened when his wife, Arlette, proposes selling off the family homestead and moving to Omaha, setting in motion a gruesome train of murder and madness. <P>In "Big Driver," a cozy-mystery writer named Tess encounters the stranger along a back road in Massachusetts when she takes a shortcut home after a book-club engagement. Violated and left for dead, Tess plots a revenge that will bring her face-to-face with another stranger: the one inside herself. <P>"Fair Extension," the shortest of these tales, is perhaps the nastiest and certainly the funniest. Making a deal with the devil not only saves Dave Streeter from a fatal cancer but provides rich recompense for a lifetime of resentment. <P>When her husband of more than twenty years is away on one of his business trips, Darcy Anderson looks for batteries in the garage. Her toe knocks up against a box under a worktable and she discovers the stranger inside her husband. It\x92s a horrifying discovery, rendered with bristling intensity, and it definitively ends a good marriage. <P><P>Like <I>Different Seasons </I>and <I>Four Past Midnight, </I>which generated such enduring films as <I>The Shawshank Redemption </I>and <I>Stand by Me, Full Dark, No Stars </I>proves Stephen King a master of the long story form.'

(S'Every Patient Tells a Story: Medical Mysteries and the Art of Diagnosis'
p4166
S'A riveting exploration of the most difficult and important part of what doctors do, by Yale School of Medicine physician Dr. Lisa Sanders, author of the monthly <i>New York Times Magazine </i>column "Diagnosis," the inspiration for the hit Fox TV series <i>House, M.D.</i> <br><br>"The experience of being ill can be like waking up in a foreign country. Life, as you formerly knew it, is on hold while you travel through this other world as unknown as it is unexpected. When I see patients in the hospital or in my office who are suddenly, surprisingly ill, what they really want to know is, \x91What is wrong with me?\x92 They want a road map that will help them manage their new surroundings. The ability to give this unnerving and unfamiliar place a name, to know it\x96on some level\x96restores a measure of control, independent of whether or not that diagnosis comes attached to a cure. Because, even today, a diagnosis is frequently all a good doctor has to offer."<br><br>A healthy young man suddenly loses his memory\x96making him unable to remember the events of each passing hour. Two patients diagnosed with Lyme disease improve after antibiotic treatment\x96only to have their symptoms mysteriously return. A young woman lies dying in the ICU\x96bleeding, jaundiced, incoherent\x96and none of her doctors know what is killing her. In <i>Every Patient Tells a Story</i>, Dr. Lisa Sanders takes us bedside to witness the process of solving these and other diagnostic dilemmas, providing a firsthand account of the expertise and intuition that lead a doctor to make the right diagnosis.<br><br>Never in human history have doctors had the knowledge, the tools, and the skills that they have today to diagnose illness and disease. And yet mistakes are made, diagnoses missed, symptoms or tests misunderstood. In this high-tech world of modern medicine, Sanders shows us that knowledge, while essential, is not sufficient to unravel the complexities of illness. She presents an unflinching look inside the detective story that marks nearly every illness\x96the diagnosis\x96revealing the combination of uncertainty and intrigue that doctors face when confronting patients who are sick or dying. Through dramatic stories of patients with baffling symptoms, Sanders portrays the absolute necessity and surprising difficulties of getting the patient\x92s story, the challenges of the physical exam, the pitfalls of doctor-to-doctor communication, the vagaries of tests, and the near calamity of diagnostic errors. In <i>Every Patient Tells a Story</i>, Dr. Sanders chronicles the real-life drama of doctors solving these difficult medical mysteries that not only illustrate the art and science of diagnosis, but often save the patients\x92 lives.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S'Harold McGee\'s On Food and Cooking is a kitchen classic. Hailed by Time magazine as "a minor masterpiece" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they\'re made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious.     <P>Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment.     <P>On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as "molecular gastronomy." Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques.     <P>Among the major themes addressed throughout this new edition are:     <P>Traditional and modern methods of food production and their influences on food quality     <P>The great diversity of methods by which people in different places and times have prepared the same ingredients     <P>Tips for selecting the best ingredients and preparing them successfully     <P>The particular substances that give foods their flavors and that give us pleasure     <P>Our evolving knowledge of the health benefits and risks of foods     <P>On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating.

And as a society, we spend billions on devices to train our brains because we\x92re continually tempted by the lure of quick fixes and effortless self-improvement. <br>\xa0<br><i>The Invisible Gorilla</i> reveals the myriad ways that our intuitions can deceive us, but it\x92s much more than a catalog of human failings.

As William McDonough and Michael Braungart argue in their provocative, visionary book, however, this approach perpetuates a one-way, "cradle to grave" manufacturing model that dates to the Industrial Revolution and casts off as much as 90 percent of the materials it uses as waste, much of it toxic. Why not challenge the notion that human industry must inevitably damage the natural world, they ask.<br><br>In fact, why not take nature itself as our model? A tree produces thousands of blossoms in order to create another tree, yet we do not consider its abundance wasteful but safe, beautiful, and highly effective; hence, "waste equals food" is the first principle the book sets forth. Products might be designed so that, after their useful life, they provide nourishment for something new-either as "biological nutrients" that safely re-enter the environment or as "technical nutrients" that circulate within closed-loop industrial cycles, without being "downcycled" into low-grade uses (as most "recyclables" now are). <br><br>Elaborating their principles from experience (re)designing everything from carpeting to corporate campuses, the authors make an exciting and viable case for change.<br>'

S'With this outrageous new novel, China Mi\xe9ville has written one of the strangest, funniest, and flat-out scariest books you will read this\x97or any other\x97year. The London that comes to life in Kraken is a weird metropolis awash in secret currents of myth and magic, where criminals, police, cultists, and wizards are locked in a war to bring about\x97or prevent\x97the End of All Things.<br><br>In the Darwin Centre at London\x92s Natural History Museum, Billy Harrow, a cephalopod specialist, is conducting a tour whose climax is meant to be the Centre\x92s prize specimen of a rare Architeuthis dux<i>\x97</i>better known as the Giant Squid. But Billy\x92s tour takes an unexpected turn when the squid suddenly and impossibly vanishes into thin air.<br><br>As Billy soon discovers, this is the precipitating act in a struggle to the death between mysterious but powerful forces in a London whose existence he has been blissfully ignorant of until now, a city whose denizens\x97human and otherwise\x97are adept in magic and murder.<br><br>There is the Congregation of God Kraken, a sect of squid worshippers whose roots go back to the dawn of humanity\x97and beyond. There is the criminal mastermind known as the Tattoo, a merciless maniac inked onto the flesh of a hapless victim. There is the FSRC\x97the Fundamentalist and Sect-Related Crime Unit\x97a branch of London\x92s finest that fights sorcery <b><br></b><br>with sorcery.

p4404
S'<i>\xa0</i><br><i>\xa0</i><br><i>"I had no idea how to find my way around this medieval city. It was getting dark. I was tired. I didn\x92t speak Arabic. I was a little frightened. But hadn\x92t I battled scorpions in the wilds of Costa Rica and prevailed? Hadn\x92t I survived fainting in a San Jos\xe9 brothel?\xa0 Hadn\x92t I once arrived in Ireland with only $10 in my pocket and made it last two weeks? Surely I could handle a walk through an unfamiliar town. So I took a breath, tightened the black scarf around my hair, and headed out to take my first solitary steps through Sana\x92a."-- from The Woman Who Fell From The Sky</i><br>\xa0<br>In a world fraught with suspicion between the Middle East and the West, it\'s hard to believe that one of the most influential newspapers in Yemen--the desperately poor, ancestral homeland of Osama bin Laden, which has made has made international headlines for being a terrorist breeding ground--would be handed over to an agnostic, Campari-drinking, single woman from Manhattan who had never set foot in the Middle East. Yet this is exactly what happened to journalist, Jennifer Steil. <br>\xa0<br>Restless in her career and her life, Jennifer, a gregarious, liberal New Yorker, initially accepts a short-term opportunity in 2006 to teach a journalism class to the staff of <i>The Yemen Observer </i>in Sana\'a, the beautiful, ancient, and very conservative capital of Yemen. Seduced by the eager reporters and the challenging prospect of teaching a free speech model of journalism there, she extends her stay to a year as the paper\'s editor-in-chief. But she is quickly confronted with the realities of Yemen--and their surprising advantages.\xa0 In teaching the basics of fair and balanced journalism to a staff that included plagiarists and polemicists, she falls in love with her career again. In confronting the blatant mistreatment and strict governance of women by their male counterparts, she learns to appreciate the strength of Arab women in the workplace. And in forging surprisingly deep friendships with women and men whose traditions and beliefs are in total opposition to her own, she learns a cultural appreciation she never could have predicted.\xa0 What\x92s more, she just so happens to meet the love of her life. <br>\xa0<br>With exuberance and bravery, <i>The Woman Who Fell from the</i> Sky offers a rare, intimate, and often surprising look at the role of the media in Muslim culture and a fascinating\xa0cultural tour of\xa0Yemen, one of the most enigmatic countries in the world.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p4434
S'<p>This book unravels  mysteries, corrects misunderstandings, and offers thoughtful, straightforward responses to common objections about the Catholic faith.<br><br>Bestselling author Scott Hahn, a convert to Catholicism, has experienced the doubts that so often drive discussions about God and the Church. In the years before his conversion, he was first a nonbeliever and then an anti-Catholic clergyman. <br><br>In REASONS TO BELIEVE, he explains the "how and why" of the Catholic faith\x97drawing from Scripture, his own struggles and those of other converts, as well as from everyday life and even natural science. Hahn shows that reason and revelation, nature and the supernatural, are not opposed to one another; rather they offer complementary evidence that God exists. But He doesn\'t merely exist. He is someone, and He has a personality, a personal style, that is discernible and knowable. Hahn leads readers to see that God created the universe with a purpose and a form\x97a form that can be found in the Book of Genesis and that is there when we view the natural world through a microscope, through a telescope, or through our contact lenses. <br><br>At the heart of the book is Hahn\'s examination of the ten "keys to the kingdom"\x97the characteristics of the Church clearly evident in the Scriptures. As the story of creation discloses, the world is a house that has a Father, a palace where the king is really present. God created the cosmos to be a kingdom, and that kingdom is the universal Church, fully revealed by Jesus Christ.</p>'

p4439
S'From the award-winning champion of culinary simplicity who gave us the bestselling <I>How to Cook Everything</i> and <I>How to Cook Everything Vegetarian</i> comes <I>Food Matters</i>, a plan for responsible eating that\'s as good for the planet as it is for your weight and your health.<P>We are finally starting to acknowledge the threat carbon emissions pose to our ozone layer, but few people have focused on the extent to which our consumption of meat contributes to global warming. Think about it this way: In terms of energy consumption, serving a typical family-of-four steak dinner is the rough equivalent of driving around in an SUV for three hours while leaving all the lights on at home.<P>Bittman offers a no-nonsense rundown on how government policy, big business marketing, and global economics influence what we choose to put on the table each evening. He demystifies buzzwords like "organic," "sustainable," and "local" and offers straightforward, budget-conscious advice that will help you make small changes that will shrink your carbon footprint -- and your waistline.<P>Flexible, simple, and non-doctrinaire, the plan is based on hard science but gives you plenty of leeway to tailor your food choices to your lifestyle, schedule, and level of commitment. Bittman, a food writer who loves to eat and eats out frequently, lost thirty-five pounds and saw marked improvement in his blood levels by simply cutting meat and processed foods out of two of his three daily meals. But the simple truth, as he points out, is that as long as you eat more vegetables and whole grains, the result will be better health for you and for the world in which we live.<P>Unlike most things that are virtuous and healthful, Bittman\'s plan doesn\'t involve sacrifice. From Spinach and Sweet Potato Salad with Warm Bacon Dressing to Breakfast Bread Pudding, the recipes in Food Matters are flavorful and sophisticated. A month\'s worth of meal plans shows you how Bittman chooses to eat and offers proof of how satisfying a mindful and responsible diet can be. Cheaper, healthier, and socially sound, <I>Food Matters</i> represents the future of American eating.'

(S'Integrating Differentiated Instruction & Understanding by Design: Connecting Content and Kids'
p4474
S'Teachers struggle every day to bring quality instruction to their students. Beset by lists of content standards and accompanying "high-stakes" accountability tests, many educators sense that both teaching and learning have been redirected in ways that are potentially impoverishing for those who teach and those who learn. Educators need a model that acknowledges the centrality of standards but also ensures that students truly understand content and can apply it in meaningful ways. For many educators, Understanding by Design addresses that need.<P>Simultaneously, teachers find it increasingly difficult to ignore the diversity of the learners who populate their classrooms. Few teachers find their work effective or satisfying when they simply "serve up" a curriculum--even an elegant one--to students with no regard for their varied learning needs. For many educators, Differentiated Instruction offers a framework for addressing learner variance as a critical component of instructional planning.<P>In this book the two models converge, providing readers fresh perspectives on two of the greatest contemporary challenges for educators: crafting powerful curriculum in a standards-dominated era and ensuring academic success for the full spectrum of learners. Each model strengthens the other. Understanding by Design is predominantly a curriculum design model that focuses on what we teach. Differentiated Instruction focuses on <i>whom</i> we teach, <i>where</i> we teach, and <i>how</i> we teach. Carol Ann Tomlinson and Jay McTighe show you how to use the principles of backward design and differentiation together to craft lesson plans that will teach essential knowledge and skills for the full spectrum of learners.<P>Connecting content and kids in meaningful ways is what teachers strive to do every day.

It combines elements of autobiography  with an exposition of Hitler\'s political ideology. Volume 1 of Mein Kampf was published in 1925 and Volume 2 in 1926.[1]<br><br>Hitler began the dictation of the book while imprisoned for what he considered to be "political crimes" after his failed revolution in Munich in November 1923. Though Hitler received many visitors earlier on, he soon devoted himself entirely to the book. As he continued, Hitler realized that it would have to be a two-volume work, with the first volume scheduled for release in early 1925. The prison governor of Landsberg noted at the time that "he [Hitler] hopes the book will run into many editions, thus enabling him to fulfill his financial obligations and to defray the expenses incurred at the time of his trial."    --- From Wikipedia'

Societies that had had a head start in food production advanced beyond the hunter-gatherer stage, and then developed religion --as well as nasty germs and potent weapons of war --and adventured on sea and land to conquer and decimate preliterate cultures. A major advance in our understanding of human societies, Guns, Germs, and Steel chronicles the way that the modern world came to be and stunningly dismantles racially based theories of human history.

Lucky for us, he found his answer in the color-rich and eclectic quarters of a diverse group of subjects, including Simon Doonan and Jonathan Adler, Faris Rotter, Andre Walker, and Olivier Zahm, in New York, Los Angeles, Paris, Tokyo, Sydney, and London. Each profile is accompanied by Selby\x92s watercolor portraits of the subjects and objects from their homes, and illustrated questionnaires, which Selby asks each sitter to fill out. This book consists of over thirty profiles, many of which have never-before-seen, selected exclusively for the book.

What will I do all day? Is there a place to plug in my lap-top?" In an attempt to find out, Mary Roach brings her tireless curiosity to bear on an array of contemporary and historical soul-searchers: scientists, schemers, engineers, mediums, all trying to prove (or disprove) that life goes on after we die. She begins the journey in rural India with a reincarnation researcher and ends up in a University of Virginia operating room where cardiologists have installed equipment near the ceiling to study out-of-body near-death experiences. Along the way, she enrolls in an English medium school, gets electromagnetically haunted at a university in Ontario, and visits a Duke University professor with a plan to weigh the consciousness of a leech. Her historical wanderings unearth soul-seeking philosophers who rummaged through cadavers and calves\' heads, a North Carolina lawsuit that established legal precedence for ghosts, and the last surviving sample of "ectoplasm" in a Cambridge University archive.'

So many night\x92s had he watched her struggle through the nightmare of his life. And now she was kissing him. Jonas had a low growl escape his<br>throat.

p4607
S'<b>2008 Silver Award Winner, Architecture Category, Independent Publisher Book Awards. and Winning entry, General Trade Illustrated Category, in the 2008 New England Book Show sponsored by Bookbuilders of Boston.</b><br />  <br />  This is a book that students of architecture will want to keep in the studio and in their backpacks. It is also a book they may want to keep out of view of their professors, for it expresses in clear and simple language things that tend to be murky and abstruse in the classroom. These 101 concise lessons in design, drawing, the creative process, and presentation\x97from the basics of "How to Draw a Line" to the complexities of color theory\x97provide a much-needed primer in architectural literacy, making concrete what too often is left nebulous or open-ended in the architecture curriculum. Each lesson utilizes a two-page format, with a brief explanation and an illustration that can range from diagrammatic to whimsical. The lesson on "How to Draw a Line" is illustrated by examples of good and bad lines; a lesson on the dangers of awkward floor level changes shows the television actor Dick Van Dyke in the midst of a pratfall; a discussion of the proportional differences between traditional and modern buildings features a drawing of a building split neatly in half between the two. Written by an architect and instructor who remembers well the fog of his own student days, <i>101 Things I Learned in Architecture School</i> provides valuable guideposts for navigating the design studio and other classes in the architecture curriculum. Architecture graduates\x97from young designers to experienced practitioners\x97will turn to the book as well, for inspiration and a guide back to basics when solving a complex design problem.'

S'"This book is for teachers who have good days and bad \x97 and whose bad days bring the suffering that comes only from something one loves. It is for teachers who refuse to harden their hearts, because they love learners, learning, and the teaching life." \x97 Parker J. Palmer [from the Introduction]    <p>    For many years, Parker Palmer has worked on behalf of teachers and others who choose their vocations for reasons of the heart but may lose heart because of the troubled, sometimes toxic systems in which they work. Hundreds of thousands of readers have benefited from his approach in THE COURAGE TO TEACH, which takes teachers on an inner journey toward reconnecting with themselves, their students, their colleagues, and their vocations, and reclaiming their passion for one of the most challenging and important of human endeavors.    <p>    This book builds on a simple premise: good teaching cannot be reduced to technique but is rooted in the identity and integrity of the teacher. Good teaching takes myriad forms but good teachers share one trait: they are authentically present in the classroom, in community with their students and their subject. They possess "a capacity for connectedness" and are able to weave a complex web of connections between themselves, their subjects, and their students, helping their students weave a world for themselves. The connections made by good teachers are held not in their methods but in their hearts \x97 the place where intellect, emotion, spirit, and will converge in the human self \x97 supported by the community that emerges among us when we choose to live authentic lives.    <p>    BONUS: Includes an audio CD featuring a 45-minute conversation between Parker Palmer and his colleagues, Marcy Jackson and Estrus Tucker from the Center for Courage & Renewal. They reflect on what they have learned from working with thousands of teachers in their "Courage to Teach" program (www.CourageRenewal.org)and with others who yearn for greater integrity in their professional lives.    <p>    <b>Note:</b> CD-ROM/DVD and other supplementary materials are not included as part of eBook file.'

S"<I>A Brief History of Time,</I> published in 1988, was a landmark volume in science writing and in world-wide acclaim and popularity, with more than 9 million copies in print globally. The original edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the ensuing years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic world--observations that have confirmed many of Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book.<P>Now a decade later, this edition updates the chapters throughout to document those advances, and also includes an entirely new chapter on Wormholes and Time Travel and a new introduction. It make vividly clear why <I>A Brief History of Time</I> has transformed our view of the universe."

p4730
S"<B>The bestselling author of <I>Mayflower</I> sheds new light on one of the iconic stories of the American West </B> <BR><BR> Little Bighorn and Custer are names synonymous in the American imagination with unmatched bravery and spectacular defeat. Mythologized as Custer's Last Stand, the June 1876 battle has been equated with other famous last stands, from the Spartans' defeat at Thermopylae to Davy Crockett at the Alamo. <BR><BR> In his tightly structured narrative, Nathaniel Philbrick brilliantly sketches the two larger-than-life antagonists: Sitting Bull, whose charisma and political savvy earned him the position of leader of the Plains Indians, and George Armstrong Custer, one of the Union's greatest cavalry officers and a man with a reputation for fearless and often reckless courage. Philbrick reminds readers that the Battle of the Little Bighorn was also, even in victory, the last stand for the Sioux and Cheyenne Indian nations. Increasingly outraged by the government's Indian policies, the Plains tribes allied themselves and held their ground in southern Montana. Within a few years of Little Bighorn, however, all the major tribal leaders would be confined to Indian reservations. <BR><BR> Throughout, Philbrick beautifully evokes the history and geography of the Great Plains with his characteristic grace and sense of drama. The Last Stand is a mesmerizing account of the archetypal story of the American West, one that continues to haunt our collective imagination."

S"*Winner of the 2010 Hugo Award for Best Novel* <br><br>*Winner of the 2010 Nebula Award for Best Novel* <br>In this Time Magazine top 10 book of the year, Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko. Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe. What Happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? In The Windup Girl, award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi returns to the world of The Calorie Man; (Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award-winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2006) and Yellow Card Man (Hugo Award nominee, 2007) in order to address these poignant questions.

Now Lumpkin has completed his work on The Third Book of Enoch. 3 Enoch has not been available to the general public for over eighty years, until now. His previous releases of 1 Enoch and 2 Enoch are placed along side The Hebrew Book of Enoch (3 Enoch,) which has been translated using Hebrew source materials and contains "in-text" commentary.

S"Professors Fischl and Paul explain law school exams in ways no one has before, all with an eye toward improving the reader's performance. The book begins by describing the difference between educational cultures that praise students for 'right answers,' and the law school culture that rewards nuanced analysis of ambiguous situations in which more than one approach may be correct. Enormous care is devoted to explaining precisely how and why legal analysis frequently produces such perplexing situations.<br><br>But the authors don't stop with mere description. Instead, Getting to Maybe teaches how to excel on law school exams by showing the reader how legal analysis can be brought to bear on examination problems. The book contains hints on studying and preparation that go well beyond conventional advice. The authors also illustrate how to argue both sides of a legal issue without appearing wishy-washy or indecisive. Above all, the book explains why exam questions may generate feelings of uncertainty or doubt about correct legal outcomes and how the student can turn these feelings to his or her advantage.<br><br>In sum, although the authors believe that no exam guide can substitute for a firm grasp of substantive material, readers who devote the necessary time to learning the law will find this book an invaluable guide to translating learning into better exam performance."

S'The framework for teaching is a research-based set of components of instruction that are grounded in a constructivist view of learning and teaching. The framework may be used for many purposes, but its full value is realized as the foundation for professional conversations among practitioners as they seek to enhance their skill in the complex task of teaching. The framework may be used as the foundation of a school\x92s or district\x92s recruitment and hiring, mentoring, coaching, professional development, and teacher evaluation processes, thus linking all those activities together and helping teachers become more thoughtful practitioners.<P> The actions teachers can take to improve student learning are clearly identified and fall under four domains of teaching responsibility: Planning and Preparation, the School Environment, Instruction, and Professional Responsibilities. Within the domains are 22 components and 76 descriptive elements that further refine our understanding of what teaching is all about. The framework defines four levels of performance--Unsatisfactory, Basic, Proficient, and Distinguished--for each element, providing a valuable tool that all teachers can use. <P> This second edition has been revised and updated and also includes frameworks for school specialists, such as school nurses, counselors, library and media specialists, and instructional coaches. Comprehensive, clear, and applicable to teaching across the K\x9612 spectrum, the framework for teaching described in this book is based on the PRAXIS III: Classroom Performance Assessment criteria developed by Educational Testing Service and is compatible with INTASC standards.'

But as peace once again settled upon the land, a lost generation of sea serpents\x97ancient, half-starved, and weary\x97returned to cocoon, certain that they would be reborn as the beautiful and powerful dragons of legend. But their arduous journey exacted a heavy toll, and the proud serpents emerged as sickly, half-formed beasts, unable to fly or hunt . . . or thrive. For years now they have been trapped on a swampy riverbank between forest and river, hungry and barely alive, reliant on humans to provide for them. </p> <p> With their survival at stake, fifteen dragons\x97among them the wise golden Mercor, the haughty and dazzling silver-blue queen Sintara, and the delicate copper beauty Relpda\x97have set off on a dangerous trek into the unknown, up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering the ancient Elderling city of Kelsingra, the lost haven for dragons and Elderlings alike. The dragons are accompanied by a disparate group of human keepers, rejects from Rain Wild society. They, too, yearn to find Kelsingra and create a home of their own, one in which they may make their own rules and decide their own fate. But is Kelsingra real or merely a fragment of a glorified past buried deep in the dragons' shared memories? No map exists to guide them, and the noble creatures find their ancient recollections of little use in a land changed by generations of flooding and seismic chaos. </p> <p> As the dragons, the humans\x97including the strong and defiant Rain Wild girl Thymara; the wealthy dragon scholar and Trader's wife, Alise; and her companion, the urbane Sedric\x97and their magical supply barge, captained by the gruff Leftrin, forge their way ever deeper into uncharted wilderness, human and beast alike discover they are changing in mysterious and dangerous ways. While the bonds between them solidify, starvation, flashfloods, and predators will imperil them all. But dragons and humans soon learn that the most savage threats come from within their own company . . . and not all of them may survive. </p> <p> Returning to the territory of her beloved Liveship Traders and Tawny Man trilogies, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Robin Hobb creates a lush and ultimately triumphant tale set in an imaginative world of magic and wonder as compelling and emotionally resonant as our own. </p>"

p4800
S'John D. Rockefeller, Sr.--history\'s first billionaire and the patriarch of America\'s most famous dynasty--is an icon whose true nature has eluded three generations of historians. Now Ron Chernow, the National Book Award-winning biographer of the Morgan and Warburg banking families, gives us a history of the mogul "etched with uncommon objectivity and literary grace . . . as detailed, balanced, and psychologically insightful a portrait of the tycoon as we may ever have" (Kirkus Reviews). Titan is the first full-length biography based on unrestricted access to Rockefeller\'s exceptionally rich trove of papers. A landmark publication full of startling revelations, the book will indelibly alter our image of this most enigmatic capitalist.<br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Born the son of a flamboyant, bigamous snake-oil salesman and a pious, straitlaced mother, Rockefeller rose from rustic origins to become the world\'s richest man by creating America\'s most powerful and feared monopoly, Standard Oil. Branded "the Octopus" by legions of muckrakers, the trust refined and marketed nearly 90 percent of the oil produced in America.<br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0Rockefeller was likely the most controversial businessman in our nation\'s history. Critics charged that his empire was built on unscrupulous tactics: grand-scale collusion with the railroads, predatory pricing, industrial espionage, and wholesale bribery of political officials. The titan spent more than thirty years dodging investigations until Teddy Roosevelt and his trustbusters embarked on a marathon crusade to bring Standard Oil to bay.<br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0While providing abundant new evidence of Rockefeller\'s misdeeds, Chernow discards the stereotype of the cold-blooded monster to sketch an unforgettably human portrait of a quirky, eccentric original. A devout Baptist and temperance advocate, Rockefeller gave money more generously--his chosen philanthropies included the Rockefeller Foundation, the University of Chicago, and what is today Rockefeller University--than anyone before him. Titan presents a finely nuanced portrait of a fascinating, complex man, synthesizing his public and private lives and disclosing numerous family scandals, tragedies, and misfortunes that have never before come to light.<br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0John D. Rockefeller\'s story captures a pivotal moment in American history, documenting the dramatic post-Civil War shift from small business to the rise of giant corporations that irrevocably transformed the nation. With cameos by Joseph Pulitzer, William Randolph Hearst, Jay Gould, William Vanderbilt, Ida Tarbell, Andrew Carnegie, Carl Jung, J. Pierpont Morgan, William James, Henry Clay Frick, Mark Twain, and Will Rogers, Titan turns Rockefeller\'s life into a vivid tapestry of American society in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It is Ron Chernow\'s signal triumph that he narrates this monumental saga with all the sweep, drama, and insight that this giant subject deserves.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S"Forget everything you thought you knew about how to motivate people--at work, at school, at home. It's wrong. As Daniel H. Pink explains in his new and paradigm- shattering book <I>Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us</I>, the secret to high performance and satisfaction in today's world is the deeply human need to direct our own lives, to learn and create new things, and to do better by ourselves and our world. <BR><BR> Drawing on four decades of scientific research on human motivation, Pink exposes the mismatch between what science knows and what business does--and how that affects every aspect of our lives. He demonstrates that while the old-fashioned carrot-and-stick approach worked successfully in the 20th century, it's precisely the <I>wrong</I> way to motivate people for today's challenges. In <I>Drive</I>, he reveals the three elements of true motivation: <BR><BR> *<B>Autonomy</B>- the desire to direct our own lives <BR> *<B>Mastery</B>- the urge to get better and better at something that matters <BR> *<B>Purpose</B>- the yearning to do what we do in the service of something larger than ourselves <BR><BR> Along the way, he takes us to companies that are enlisting new approaches to motivation and introduces us to the scientists and entrepreneurs who are pointing a bold way forward. <BR><BR> <I>Drive</I> is bursting with big ideas-- the rare book that will change how you think and transform how you live."

He asks the question: what makes high-achievers different? His answer is that we pay too much attention to what successful people are like, and too little attention to where they are from: that is, their culture, their family, their generation, and the idiosyncratic experiences of their upbringing. Along the way he explains the secrets of software billionaires, what it takes to be a great soccer player, why Asians are good at math, and what made the Beatles the greatest rock band. <br><br> Brilliant and entertaining, OUTLIERS is a landmark work that will simultaneously delight and illuminate.'

To investigate, Borl\xfa must travel from the decaying Beszel to its equal, rival, and intimate neighbor, the vibrant city of Ul Qoma. But this is a border crossing like no other, a journey as psychic as it is physical, a seeing of the unseen. With Ul Qoman detective Qussim Dhatt, Borl\xfa is enmeshed in a sordid underworld of nationalists intent on destroying their neighboring city, and unificationists who dream of dissolving the two into one. As the detectives uncover the dead woman\x92s secrets, they begin to suspect a truth that could cost them more than their lives. What stands against them are murderous powers in Beszel and in Ul Qoma: and, most terrifying of all, that which lies between these two cities.'

Arranged schematically, the book uses the inherent structure of the chakra system as a map upon which to chart our Western understanding of individual development. Each chapter focuses on a single chakra, starting with a description of its characteristics, then exploring its particular childhood developmental patterns, traumas and abuses, and how to heal and maintain balance. Illuminated with personal anecdotes and case studies, EASTERN BODY, WESTERN MIND seamlessly merges the East and West, science and philosophy, and psychology and spirituality into a compelling interpretation of the chakra system and its relevance for Westerners today.'

p4984
S'Hundreds of medical doctors utilize Dr. Fuhrman s Eat For Health system in their medical practice.

The outcome is that when you eat enough high nutrient foods you can reverse most medical problems without drugs.

p5003
S'What is understanding and how does it differ from knowledge? How can we determine the big ideas worth understanding? Why is understanding an important teaching goal, and how do we know when students have attained it? How can we create a rigorous and engaging curriculum that focuses on understanding and leads to improved student performance in today\x92s high-stakes, standards-based environment?  <P>Authors Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe answer these and many other questions in this second edition of <i>Understanding by Design</i>. Drawing on feedback from thousands of educators around the world who have used the UbD framework since its introduction in 1998, the authors have greatly revised and expanded their original work to guide educators across the K-16 spectrum in the design of curriculum, assessment, and instruction. With an improved UbD Template at its core, the book explains the rationale of <i>backward design</i> and explores in greater depth the meaning of such key ideas as <i>essential questions</i> and <i>transfer tasks</i>. Readers will learn why the familiar coverage- and activity-based approaches to curriculum design fall short, and how a focus on the <i>six facets of understanding</i> can enrich student learning. With an expanded array of practical strategies, tools, and examples from all subject areas, the book demonstrates how the research-based principles of Understanding by Design apply to district frameworks as well as to individual units of curriculum.  <P>Combining provocative ideas, thoughtful analysis, and tested approaches, <i>Understanding by Design, 2nd edition</i>, offers teacher-designers a clear path to the creation of curriculum that ensures better learning and a more stimulating experience for students and teachers alike.'

(S'Tribes: We Need You to Lead Us'
p5112
S'A tribe is any group of people, large or small, who are connected to one another, a leader, and an idea. For millions of years, humans have been seeking out tribes, be they religious, ethnic, economic, political, or even musical (think of the Deadheads). It\x92s our nature.<BR><BR> Now the Internet has eliminated the barriers of geography, cost, and time. All those blogs and social networking sites are helping existing tribes get bigger. But more important, they\x92re enabling countless new tribes to be born\x97groups of ten or ten thousand or ten million who care about their iPhones, or a political campaign, or a new way to fight global warming.<BR><BR> And so the key question: Who is going to lead us?<BR><BR> The Web can do amazing things, but it can\x92t provide leadership. That still has to come from individuals\x97 people just like you who have passion about something. The explosion in tribes means that anyone who wants to make a difference now has the tools at her fingertips.<BR><BR> If you think leadership is for other people, think again\x97leaders come in surprising packages. Consider Joel Spolsky and his international tribe of scary-smart software engineers. Or Gary Vaynerhuck, a wine expert with a devoted following of enthusiasts. Chris Sharma leads a tribe of rock climbers up impossible cliff faces, while Mich Mathews, a VP at Microsoft, runs her internal tribe of marketers from her cube in Seattle. All they have in common is the desire to change things, the ability to connect a tribe, and the willingness to lead.<BR><BR> If you ignore this opportunity, you risk turning into a \x93sheepwalker\x94\x97someone who fights to protect the status quo at all costs, never asking if obedience is doing you (or your organization) any good. Sheepwalkers don\x92t do very well these days.<BR><BR> Tribes will make you think (really think) about the opportunities in leading your fellow employees, customers, investors, believers, hobbyists, or readers. . . . It\x92s not easy, but it\x92s easier than you think.'

S'<B> Those who carry the truth sometimes bear a terrible weight... </B><BR><BR> It is 1940. France has fallen. Bombs are dropping on London. And President Roosevelt is promising he won\'t send our boys to fight in "foreign wars." <BR><BR> But American radio gal Frankie Bard, the first woman to report from the Blitz in London, wants  nothing more than to bring the war home. Frankie\'s radio dispatches crackle across the Atlantic ocean, imploring listeners to pay attention--as the Nazis bomb London nightly, and Jewish refugees stream across Europe. Frankie is convinced that if she can just get the right story, it will wake Americans to action and they will join the fight. <BR><BR> Meanwhile, in Franklin, Massachusetts, a small town on Cape Cod, Iris James hears Frankie\'s broadcasts and knows that it is only a matter of time before the war arrives on Franklin\'s shores. In charge of the town\'s mail, Iris believes that her job is to deliver and keep people\'s secrets, passing along the news that letters carry. And one secret she keeps are her feelings for Harry Vale, the town mechanic, who inspects the ocean daily, searching in vain for German U-boats he is certain will come. Two single people in midlife, Iris and Harry long ago gave up hope of ever being in love, yet they find themselves unexpectedly drawn toward each other. <BR><BR> Listening to Frankie as well are Will and Emma Fitch, the town\'s doctor and his new wife, both trying to escape a fragile childhood and forge a brighter future. When Will follow\'s Frankie\'s siren call into the war, Emma\'s worst fears are realized. Promising to return in six months, Will goes to London to offer his help, and the lives of the three women entwine. <BR><BR> Alternating between an America still cocooned in its inability to grasp the danger at hand and a Europe being torn apart by war, <I>The Postmistress</I> gives us two women who find themselves unable to deliver the news, and a third woman desperately waiting for news yet afraid to hear it. <BR><BR> Sarah Blake\'s <I>The Postmistress</I> shows how we bear the fact that war goes on around us while ordinary lives continue. Filled with stunning parallels to today, it is a remarkable novel.'

This edition of the book has several new chapters that are geared toward success both in law school and in the job market. A new chapter on legal analysis addresses one of the most common problems professors see on law school exams--the absence of the counterargument. New materials on interviewing techniques, creating a writing sample, and writing a resume are designed to help students market themselves to prospective employers. Whether students are seeking advice in the summer months or are looking for help once the school year has begun, this book is an important tool for helping them get the most out of their abilities."

S"Language may be a teacher's most powerful tool. Every day the words, phrases, tone, and pace you use have the power to help students develop self-control, build their sense of belonging, and gain skills and knowledge. This book, by an author with more than twenty years of experience teaching children and educators, will help you recognize the influence your words have on the children you teach. It will show you how to use language more skillfully, building a classroom where students feel safe, respected, appreciated, and excited about learning. Full of practical tips, real life anecdotes, and concrete examples, this warm and thought-provoking guide includes specific suggestions about language to adopt and language to avoid. Topics include: using language to help children envision success; open-ended questions that stretch children's thinking; listening and using silence skillfully; the 3 Rs of teacher language: reinforcing, reminding, and redirecting; saying what you mean and meaning what you say; giving brief, concrete instructions; offering meaningful, specific encouragement. The sensible approach this book advocates is backed by research and proven through decades of successful practice in elementary classrooms nationwide. It offers ideas beginners can try immediately and a wealth of guidance and support for those farther along in the process of changing their language."

We asked each of them for the same thing?a story about a warrior. Some chose to write in the genre they\x92re best known for. Some decided to try something different. You will find warriors of every shape, size, and color in these pages, warriors from every epoch of human history, from yesterday and today and tomorrow, and from worlds that never were. Some of the stories will make you sad, some will make you laugh, and many will keep you on the edge of your seat.\x94 <BR><BR>Included are a long novella from the world of Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin, a new tale of Lord John by Diana Gabaldon, and an epic of humanity at bay by David Weber. Also present are original tales by David Ball, Peter S.

S'THE #1 NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER <br>Millions of readers literally defined their lives through Gail Sheehy\'s landmark bestseller Passages. Seven years ago she set out to write a sequel, but instead she discovered a historic revolution in the adult life cycle. . . <br>People are taking longer to grow up and much longer to die. A fifty-year-old woman--who remains free of cancer and heart disease-- can expect to see her ninety-second birthday. Men, too, can expect a dramatically lengthened life span. The old demarcations and descriptions of adulthood--beginning at twenty-one and ending at sixty-five--are hopelessly out of date. In New Passages, Gail Sheehy discovers and maps out a completely new frontier--a Second Adulthood in middle life.<br>"Stop and recalculate," Sheehy writes. "Imagine the day you turn forty-five as the infancy of another life." Instead of declining, men and women who embrace a Second Adulthood are progressing through entirely new passages into lives of deeper meaning, renewed playfulness, and creativity--beyond both male and female menopause. Through hundreds of personal and group interviews, national surveys of professionals and working-class people, and fresh findings extracted from fifty years of U.S. Census reports, Sheehy vividly dramatizes these newly developing stages. Combining the scholar\'s ability to synthesize data with the novelist\'s gift for storytelling, she allows us to make sense of our own lives by understanding others like us.<br>New Passages tells us we have the ability to customize our own life cycle. This groundbreaking work is certain to awaken and permanently alter the way we think about ourselves.<br>"SHEEHY CLEARLY STATES IDEAS ABOUT LIFE THAT HAVE NEVER BEFORE BEEN AS CLEARLY STATED."<br>--Los Angeles Times Book Review<br>"AN OPTIMISTIC ANALYSIS OF ADULT DEVELOPMENT IN PESSIMISTIC TIMES. . .

p5405
S"The pile of recent dieting books is growing faster than the average American's waistline. From the well-known programs that deprive and restrict to ones that rely on juice alone, it seems that everybody has an answer to the growing problem of obesity.<P>When Jon Gabriel's life took an unexpected turn, he suddenly was awakened to the marvelous gift that he had been given -- the opportunity to live -- and was disgusted at how he had treated his body. At over four hundred pounds, walking, sleeping, and working was a struggle against gravity, and his life was a constant battle between emotional and physical satiation. He was slowly killing himself with food.<P>Like the estimated 58 percent of Americans, and rising numbers in other countries, Jon was trapped in what he came to call the FAT - Famine and Temperature - trap. By studying biochemistry, Gabriel learned that your body has an internal logic that determines how fat or thin you will be at any given time. The way to lose weight is not to struggle or to force yourself to lose weight but to understand this internal logic and work with it so that your body wants to be thinner. When your body wants to be thinner, weight loss is inevitable and becomes automatic and effortless. You simply crave less food, you crave healthier foods, your metabolism speeds up and you become very efficient at burning fat, just like a naturally thin person. And that's the real transformation -- to transform yourself into a naturally thin person, so that you can eat whatever you want whenever you want and still be thin, fit, and vibrantly healthy.<P>After reading <I>The Gabriel Method</i>, you will learn:<blockquote><li>Your body has a reason why it's holding on to weight--and it's not your fault.</li><li>Fat is a cushion--a protective barrier that our mind believes is helping to protect us. </li><li>If you can change that belief, you can change your body; Stop the cycle of crash dieting and start eating what you want, when you want it.</li><li>How to choose healthy, nutritious foods that nourish the cells in your body, not starve them.</li><li>Delicious shakes and smoothies, and super-power supplements, that can jump start your success.</li><li>The simple way you can train your mind and body to work with your goal of health, not against it.</li><li>Eliminate the emotional and mental reasons your body holds on to weight in just 10 minutes a day.</li></blockquote><P>It certainly worked for Jon; he lost 225 pounds in two-and-a-half years, going from 409 pounds to 184, without suffering, dieting, or anguishing over his body. Unlike most people who lose an extensive amount of weight, his skin tightened up and now is indistinguishable from that of a person who has been healthy his whole life."

Yet they remain among the most mysterious of concepts. Is  space an entity? Why does time have a direction? Could the universe exist  without space and time? Can we travel to the past?

From Newton\x92s unchanging realm in which  space and time are absolute, to Einstein\x92s fluid conception of spacetime, to  quantum mechanics\x92 entangled arena where vastly distant objects can  instantaneously coordinate their behavior, Greene takes us all, regardless of  our scientific backgrounds, on an irresistible and revelatory journey to the new  layers of reality that modern physics has discovered lying just beneath the  surface of our everyday world.'

S'<strong>Finalist for the 2010 National Book Award in Fiction: A powerful, soaring novel about a stolen desk  that contains the secrets, and becomes the obsession,  of the lives it passes through.</strong>  For twenty-five years, a reclusive American novelist has been writing at the desk she inherited from a young Chilean poet who disappeared at the hands of Pinochet\x92s secret police; one day a girl claiming to be the poet\x92s daughter arrives to take it away, sending the writer\x92s life reeling.  Across the ocean, in the leafy suburbs of London, a man caring for his dying wife discovers, among her papers, a lock of hair that unravels a terrible secret. In Jerusalem, an antiques dealer slowly reassembles his father\x92s study, plundered by the Nazis in Budapest in 1944.   <br /><br />  Connecting these stories is a desk of many drawers that exerts a power over those who possess it or have given it away. As the narrators of <em>Great House</em> make their confessions, the desk takes on more and more meaning, and comes finally to stand for all that has been taken from them, and all that binds them to what has disappeared.   <br /><br />  <em>Great House</em> is a story haunted by questions: What do we pass on to our children and how do they absorb our dreams and losses? How do we respond to disappearance, destruction, and change?  <br /><br />  Nicole Krauss has written a soaring, powerful novel about memory struggling to create a meaningful permanence in the face of inevitable loss.'

In The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan ingeniously demonstrates how people and domesticated plants have formed a <br>similarly reciprocal relationship. He masterfully links four fundamental human desires\x97sweetness, beauty, intoxication, and control\x97with the plants that satisfy them: the apple, the tulip, marijuana, and the potato. In telling the stories of four familiar species, Pollan illustrates how the plants have evolved to satisfy humankind\x92s most basic yearnings. And just as we\x92ve benefited from these plants, we have also done well by them. So who is really domesticating whom?'

p5509
S'Do you know what the best feature is in <em>All New Square Foot Gardening</em>?  <p>Sure, there are ten new features in this all-new, updated book. Sure, it\'s even simpler than it was before. Of course, you don\'t have to worry about fertilizer or poor soil ever again because you\'ll be growing above the ground.</p>  <p>But, the best feature is that "anyone," "anywhere" can enjoy a Square Foot garden. Children, adults with limited mobility, even complete novices can achieve spectacular results.</p>  <p>But, let\'s get back to the ten improvements. You\'re going to love them.</p>  <p>1) New Location - Move your garden closer to your house by eliminating single-row gardening. Square Foot Garden needs just "twenty percent" of the space of a traditional garden.</p>  <p>2) New Direction - Locate your garden "on top" of existing soil. Forget about pH soil tests, double-digging (who enjoys that?), or the never-ending soil improvements.</p>  <p>3) New Soil - The new "Mel\'s Mix" is the perfect growing mix. Why, we even give you the recipe. Best of all, you can even "buy" the different types of compost needed.</p>  <p>4) New Depth - You only need to prepare a SFG box to a depth of 6 inches! It\'s true--the majority of plants develop just fine when grown at this depth.</p>  <p>5) No Fertilizer - The all new SFG does not need any fertilizer-ever! If you start with the perfect soil mix, then you don\'t need to add fertilizer.</p>  <p>6) New Boxes - The new method uses bottomless boxes placed aboveground. We show you how to build your own (with step-by-step photos).</p>  <p>7) New Aisles - The ideal gardening aisle width is about three to four feet. That makes it even easier to kneel, work, and harvest.</p>  <p>8)New Grids - Prominent and permanent grids added to your SFG box help you visualize the planting squares and know how to space for maximum harvest.</p>  <p>9)New Seed Saving Idea - The old-fashioned way advocates planting many seeds and then thinning the extras (that means pulling them up). The new method means planting a pinch- literally two or three seeds--per planting hole.</p>  <p>10) Tabletop Gardens - The new boxes are so much smaller and lighter (only 6 inches of soil, remember?), you can add a plywood bottom to make them portable.</p>  Of course, that\'s not all. We\'ve also included simple, easy-to-follow instructions using lots of photos and illustrations. You\'re going to love it!'

p5549
S"In his articles and in best-selling books such as The Botany of Desire, Michael Pollan has established himself as one of our most important and beloved writers on modern man's place in the natural world. A new literary classic, Second Nature has become a manifesto not just for gardeners but for environmentalists everywhere. Chosen by the American Horticultural Society as one of the seventy-five greatest books ever written about gardening, Second Nature captures the rhythms of our everyday engagement with the outdoors in all its glory and exasperation. With chapters ranging from a reconsideration of the Great American Lawn, a dispatch from one man's war with a woodchuck, to an essay about the sexual politics of roses, Pollan has created a passionate and eloquent argument for reconceiving our relationship with nature."

S'Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children\'s imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn\'t stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.<P>Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents\' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.<P>What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.<P>For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story. A regular contributor to MSNBC.com, she lives in New York and Long Island and is married to the writer John Taylor.'

S"The mere thought of having to take a required calculus course is enough to make legions of students break out in a cold sweat. Others who have no intention of ever studying the subject have this notion that calculus is impossibly difficult unless you happen to be a direct descendant of Einstein.    <p>    Well, the good news is that you <i>can</i> master calculus. It's not nearly as tough as its mystique would lead you to think. Much of calculus is really just very advanced algebra, geometry, and trig. It builds upon and is a logical extension of those subjects. If you can do algebra, geometry, and trig, you can do calculus.    <p>    <i>Calculus For Dummies</i> is intended for three groups of readers:            <li><b>Students taking their first calculus course</b>\xa0\x96\xa0If you're enrolled in a calculus course and you find your textbook less than crystal clear, this is the book for you. It covers the most important topics in the first year of calculus: differentiation, integration, and infinite series.      <li><b>Students who need to brush up on their calculus to prepare for other studies</b>\xa0\x96\xa0If you've had elementary calculus, but it's been a couple of years and you want to review the concepts to prepare for, say, some graduate program, <i>Calculus For Dummies</i> will give you a thorough, no-nonsense refresher course.      <li><b>Adults of all ages who'd like a good introduction to the subject</b>\xa0\x96\xa0Non-student readers will find the book's exposition clear and accessible. <i>Calculus For Dummies</i> takes calculus out of the ivory tower and brings it down to earth.      </ul>    <p>    This is a user-friendly math book. Whenever possible, the author explains the calculus concepts by showing you connections between the calculus ideas and easier ideas from algebra and geometry. Then, you'll see how the calculus concepts work in concrete examples. All explanations are in plain English, not math-speak. <i>Calculus For Dummies</i> covers the following topics and more:            <li>Real-world examples of calculus      <li>The two big ideas of calculus: differentiation and integration      <li>Why calculus works      <li>Pre-algebra and algebra review      <li>Common functions and their graphs      <li>Limits and continuity      <li>Integration and approximating area      <li>Sequences and series      </ul>    <p>    Don't buy the misconception.

President, Holistic Dental Association    --It is a life and thought changing book written by a man who\'s not trying to sell you anything. How rare is that?-- David, Idaho    --This is a very different type of health book, written from the heart. The dietary advice put forth in this book is not only crucial for preventing tooth decay but for preserving the health of the human race.-- Margie, Connecticut    --I was ready to have a tooth pulled and the dentist told me I needed a root canal but I had no money. I was in pain and the cheek had actually started to swell up. Within three weeks of trying the diet I could tell I was turning the corner. The tooth stopped hurting; my teeth all over became whiter.

I was very worried and upset about my daughter\'s teeth at first, but now I am actually very calm because I know I am doing the right thing.-- Marina, Canada  --The great thing about this book is that it allowed me to take control over problems that I had once felt I had little control over no matter how hard I tried.

An applied animal behaviorist and dog trainer with more than twenty years experience, Dr. Patricia McConnell looks at humans as just another interesting species, and muses about why we behave the way we do around our dogs, how dogs might interpret our behavior, and how to interact with our dogs in ways that bring out the best in our four-legged friends.<u> </u><b><br><br></b>After all, although humans and dogs share a remarkable relationship that is unique in the animal world, we are still two entirely different species, each shaped by our individual evolutionary heritage. Quite simply, humans are primates and dogs are canids (like wolves, coyotes, and foxes). Since we each speak a different native tongue, a lot gets lost in the translation.<br><br><i>The Other End of the Leash</i> demonstrates how even the slightest changes in your voice and the way you stand can help your dog understand what you want. Once you start to think about your own behavior from the perspective of your dog, you\x92ll understand why much of what appears to be doggy-disobedience is simply a case of miscommunication. Inside you will learn<br>\x95 How to use your voice so that your dog is more likely to do what you ask.<br>\x95 Why \x93getting dominance\x94 over your dog is a bad idea.<br>\x95 Why \x93rough and tumble primate play\x94 can lead to trouble\x96and how to play with your dog in ways that are fun and keep him out of trouble.<br>\x95 How dogs and humans share personality types\x96and why most dogs want to live with benevolent leaders rather than \x93alphawannabees!\x94<br><br>In her own insightful, compelling style, Patricia McConnell combines wonderful true stories about people and dogs with a new, accessible scientific perspective on how they should behave around each other. This is a book that strives to help you make the most of life with your dog, and to prevent problems that might arise in that most rewarding of relationships.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

(S'Portrait Painting Atelier: Old Master Techniques and Contemporary Applications'
p5677
S'The art of portraiture approached its apex during the sixteenth century in Europe with the discovery of oil painting when the old masters developed and refined techniques that remain unsurpassed to this day. The ascendance of nonrepresentational art in the middle of the twentieth century displaced these venerable skills, especially in academic art circles. Fortunately for aspiring artists\xa0today who wish to learn the methods that allowed the Old Masters to achieve the luminous color and subtle tonalities so characteristic of their work, this knowledge has been preserved in hundreds of small traditional painting ateliers that persevered in the old ways in this country and throughout the world.<br><br>Coming out of this dedicated movement, <i>Portrait Painting Atelier</i> is an essential resource for an art community still recovering from a time when solid instruction in art technique was unavailable in our schools. Of particular value here is a demonstration of the Old Masters\x92 technique of layering paint over a toned-ground surface, a process that builds from the transparent dark areas to the more densely painted lights. This method unifies the entire painting, creating a beautiful glow that illuminates skin tones and softly blends all the color tones. Readers will also find valuable instruction in paint mediums from classic oil-based to alkyd-based, the interactive principles of composition and photograph-based composition, and the anatomy of the human face and the key relationships among its features. <br><br>Richly illustrated with the work of preeminent masters such as Millet, G\xe9ricault, and van Gogh, as well as some of today\x92s leading portrait artists\x97and featuring seven detailed step-by-step portrait demonstrations\x97<i>Portrait Painting Atelier</i> is the first book in many years to so comprehensively cover the concepts and techniques of traditional portraiture.'

p5712
S'Yes, humans and canines are different species, but current research provides fascinating, irrefutable evidence that what we share with our dogs is greater than how we vary. As behaviorist and zoologist Dr. Patricia McConnell tells us in this remarkable new book about emotions in dogs and in people, more and more scientists accept the premise that dogs have rich emotional lives, exhibiting a wide range of feelings including fear, anger, surprise, sadness, and love.<br><br>In For the Love of a Dog, McConnell suggests that one of the reasons we love dogs so much is that they express emotions in ways similar to humans. After all, who can communicate joy better than a puppy? But not all emotional expressions are obvious, and McConnell teaches both beginning dog owners and experienced dog lovers how to read the more subtle expressions hidden behind fuzzy faces and floppy ears. <br><br>For those of us who deeply cherish our dogs but are sometimes baffled by their behavior, For the Love of a Dog will come as a revelation\x96a treasure trove of useful facts, informed speculation, and intriguing accounts of man\x92s best friend at his worst and at his very best. Readers will discover how fear, anger, and happiness underlie the lives of both people and dogs and, most important, how understanding emotion in both species can improve the relationship between them. Thus McConnell introduces us to the possibility of a richer, more rewarding relationship with our dogs.<br><br>While we may never be absolutely certain what our dogs are feeling, with the help of this riveting book we can understand more than we ever thought possible. Those who consider their dogs part of the family will find For the Love of a Dog engaging, enlightening, and utterly engrossing.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

(S'Cancer-Free: Your Guide to Gentle, Non-toxic Healing (Third Edition)'
p5790
S'"If you love your stricken one, this is your Bible."   said Denzel Koh of Brisbane, Australia after he healed his daughter\'s   cancer using the information in a previous edition of this book.       <P>A cancer diagnosis always causes fear. All of us have   seen relatives and friends destroyed by conventional cancer treatment. Now,   thanks to books like this one and the Internet, you can quickly learn what   you need to know. You can heal the cancer using natural, non-toxic   substances that work. What you need is a guide to cut through the   overwhelming jungle of information.     <P>This book   provides that guide. The information in it has been refined over eight   years using feedback from real cancer survivors about what worked for them.   The author has counseled hundreds of cancer patients by phone and e-mail in   58 countries. At least 1,500 of them have recovered using his information.     <P>   He is not a medical professional. He is a   "reporter" furnishing you with information that consists of   "what he would do if he were you or your loved one." His coaching   is available to you after you have read this book, if you need it.       <P>Bill Henderson has published 105 free newsletters on   natural cancer treatment to 8,000 subscribers all over the world, starting   in 1999. The information in these newsletters has now been incorporated   into this, his third book. The book is up-to-date, specific and   accurate.     <P>Bill informs you of over 140 web   sites and dozens of other books and newsletters you can use to expand your   knowledge of natural cancer treatment.      <P>The   self-treatments he recommends are harmless enough that you can start them   immediately, without more research, if you like. They do not interfere with   conventional cancer therapy, if that is your choice. In fact, they offset   most of the side effects of that treatment.       <P>"Cancer is not a disease," says Bill. "It is a reaction   to what your body has experienced. Reverse that cause and the cancer goes   away. Continue what you did to reverse it and it stays away."       <P>Bill explains that there are four common   characteristics of all cancers. These have been known since the   1920\'s:     <P>1. Low oxygen uptake by the   cells.     <P>2. A weak immune system.       <P>3. Toxins -- usually caused by diet.       <P>4. Acidity -- again, usually caused by diet.       <P>Bill Henderson\'s recommended regimen tracks with the   knowledge for which Otto Warburg, a famous German doctor and researcher,   won a Nobel Prize in 1931. He described the cancer cell and stressed the   need to reverse the above four characteristics of the cancer in order to   heal it.     <P>Bill\'s mission to help cancer   patients heal started with his experience with his former wife, Marjorie.   Her ovarian cancer was treated with conventional cancer treatment from 1990   to 1994, when she died. Bill is convinced that the treatment killed her. He   wants to help as many people as possible avoid her fate.'

S'\x93Wake up, Muffy. We\x92re back.\x94<br><br>From Lisa Birnbach, the author of <i>The Official Preppy Handbook</i>\x97and designer Chip Kidd\x97comes a whole new take on the prep world that Birnbach turned into an international best-selling phenomenon thirty years ago.<br><i><br>True Prep</i> is a contemporary look at how the old guard of natural-fiber-loving, dog-worshipping, G&T-soaked preppies adapt to the new order of things. Birnbach considers the prep attitude towards money (ambivalent), schools (good investment), wardrobe (now your clothes fit), work (some careers will never be prep), decorating (ask mummy), scandal (including rehab and prison), and food and drink (with some classic recipes for both). She also looks at weekends (and what to do to get asked back), entertaining, sports (including sailing and shopping), weddings, etiquette, the Internet and electronic gadgetry, political correctness, reality TV, and . . . polar fleece. And last but not least: a do-it-yourself eulogy. <br><br>With more than 200 original illustrations and photographs, <i>True Prep</i> promises to be a whole new, old sensation.'

S'<blockquote> <p> No longer can we be Barack Obama\'s sheeple and let the American Dream be trampled, beaten, and burned to the ground </p> </blockquote> <p> <i>Trickle Up Poverty</i>, by bestselling author and revered radio host Dr. Michael Savage, is your best defense against the Obamanomics that are dragging the middle class, and everyone else, into a Marxist-Socialist death spiral. The Savage manifesto you hold in your hands shows how Obama is circumventing the Constitution to push through his radical agenda\x97and, most important, how we can restore our country to the power and prestige that Barack Obama and his corrupt and degenerate "czars" are trying to destroy. </p> <p> The Naked Marxist can and must be stopped. Obama\'s trickle up poverty is infecting all that we hold to be true and self-evident. Here\'s how: </p> <p> Impoverishing the Middle Class: Obama\'s confiscatory taxes, the socializing of our health-care system, and other legislative initiatives are taking away our earnings and our power to choose how we live our lives and putting it in the hands of corrupt and pro-Socialist cohorts. </p> <p> Erasing Our Border with Mexico: The Homeland Security department that can\'t shoot straight is gutting the Constitution in the name of protecting illegal aliens when it should be focusing on keeping out the terrorists and drug dealers. </p> <p> Defunding the Military and Putting Our Troops in Harm\'s Way: Obama\'s beatnik policy of taking apart our nuclear arsenal and destroying NASA, while implementing PC Rules of Engagement that don\'t allow our troops to protect themselves, is dangerously weakening our security and ending our military dominance. </p> <p> Lining the Pockets of His Wall Street Buddies: While our 401(k)\'s suffer, Obama and his Wall Street heavy contributors are creating their own legislation that is driving down stock prices while allowing his biggest campaign contributors to make <i>trillions</i> of dollars. </p> <p> Propagandizing the Media: Once a forum for free speech, Obama\'s administration has systematically overrun the media in a hostile takeover with threats and false promises that serve only to pull the wool over the sheeple\'s eyes. </p> <p> Ignoring the Tea Party\x97the Voice of the People: No longer a representative government, Obama is blatantly disregarding, and even suppressing, the fastest-growing collective voice in the nation right now\x97that of the patriotic Tea Party. His Union-Crony Purple Shirts have shown up at town-hall meetings and peaceful protests to intimidate and antagonize the democratic process. </p> <p> We are dangerously close to losing the nation we love, but it\'s not too late. If you buy only one book to learn and react to what Obama the Destroyer has done and plans on doing to America, this is it! </p>'

p5934
S'In <b>America\x92s Constitution</b>, one of this era\x92s most accomplished constitutional law scholars, Akhil Reed Amar, gives the first comprehensive account of one of the world\x92s great political texts. Incisive, entertaining, and occasionally controversial, this \x93biography\x94 of America\x92s framing document explains not only what the Constitution says but also why the Constitution says it. <br><br>We all know this much: the Constitution is neither immutable nor perfect. Amar shows us how the story of this one relatively compact document reflects the story of America more generally. (For example, much of the Constitution, including the glorious-sounding \x93We the People,\x94 was lifted from existing American legal texts, including early state constitutions.) In short, the Constitution was as much a product of its environment as it was a product of its individual creators\x92 inspired genius.<br><br>Despite the Constitution\x92s flaws, its role in guiding our republic has been nothing short of amazing. Skillfully placing the document in the context of late-eighteenth-century American politics, America\x92s Constitution explains, for instance, whether there is anything in the Constitution that is unamendable; the reason America adopted an electoral college; why a president must be at least thirty-five years old; and why\x96for now, at least\x96only those citizens who were born under the American flag can become president. <br><br>From his unique perspective, Amar also gives us unconventional wisdom about the Constitution and its significance throughout the nation\x92s history. For one thing, we see that the Constitution has been far more democratic than is conventionally understood. Even though the document was drafted by white landholders, a remarkably large number of citizens (by the standards of 1787) were allowed to vote up or down on it, and the document\x92s later amendments eventually extended the vote to virtually all Americans. <br><br>We also learn that the Founders\x92 Constitution was far more slavocratic than many would acknowledge: the \x93three fifths\x94 clause gave the South extra political clout for every slave it owned or acquired. As a result, slaveholding Virginians held the presidency all but four of the Republic\x92s first thirty-six years, and proslavery forces eventually came to dominate much of the federal government prior to Lincoln\x92s election.<br><br>Ambitious, even-handed, eminently accessible, and often surprising, <b>America\x92s Constitution</b> is an indispensable work, bound to become a standard reference for any student of history and all citizens of the United States.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S'You Can Start a Revolution in Your Family . . . Tonight<br><br><i>ScreamFree Parenting</i> is not just about lowering your voice. It\x92s about learning to calm your emotional reactions and learning to focus on your own behavior more than your kids\x92 behavior . . . for their benefit. Our biggest enemy as parents is not the TV, the Internet, or even drugs. Our biggest enemy is our own <i>emotional reactivity</i>. When we say we \x93lost it\x94 with our kids, the \x93it\x94 in that sentence is our own <i>adulthood</i>. And then we wonder why our kids have so little respect for us, why our kids seem to have all the power in the family.<br><br>It\x92s time to do it differently. And you can. You can start to create and enjoy the types of calm, mutually respectful, and loving relationships with your kids that you\x92ve always craved. You can begin to revolutionize your family, starting tonight.<br><br><b>Parenting is not about kids, it\x92s about parents.<br>If you\x92re not in control, then you cannot be in charge.<br>What every kid really needs are parents who are able to keep their cool no matter what. <br><br></b>Easier said than done? Not anymore, thanks to ScreamFree Parenting, the principle-based approach that\x92s inspiring parents everywhere to truly revolutionize their family dynamics. Moving beyond the child-centered, technique-based approaches that ultimately fail, the ScreamFree way compels you to:<br><br>focus on yourself<br>calm yourself down, and<br> grow yourself up<br><br>By staying calm <i>and </i>connected with your kids, you begin to operate less out of your deepest fears and more out of your highest principles, revolutionizing your relationships in the process.<br><i><br>ScreamFree Parenting</i> is not just another parenting book. It\x92s the <i><b>first </b></i>parenting<br>book that maintains\x97from beginning to end\x97that <b>parenting is NOT about kids . . . it\x92s about parents</b>. As parents pay more attention to controlling their <i>own</i> behavior instead of their kids\x92 behavior, the result is stronger, more rewarding, and more fulfilling family relationships.<br><br>For those of you reading who <i>are </i>parents, <i>know </i>parents, or have <i>had </i>parents, the notion that the greatest thing you can do for your children is to learn to focus on yourself may sound strange, even heretical. It\x92s not. Here\x92s why: <i>we </i>are the only ones we can control. We cannot control our kids\x97we cannot control the behavior of any other human being. And yet, so many \x93experts\x94 keep giving us more tools (\x93techniques\x94) to help us try to do just that. And, of course, the more we try to control, the more out of control our children become.<br><br>\x93Don\x92t make me come up there.\x94 \x93Don\x92t make me pull this car over.\x94 \x93How many times do I have to tell you?\x94 Even our language suggests that our kids have control over us.<br>It\x92s no wonder that we end up screaming. Or shutting down. Or simply giving up. And the charts, refrigerator magnets, family meetings, and other techniques in most typical parenting books just don\x92t work. They end up making us feel more frustrated and more powerless in this whole parenting thing.<br><br>This practical, effective guide for parents of all ages with kids of all ages introduces proven principles for overcoming the anxieties and stresses of parenting and setting new patterns of connection and cooperation. Well-written in an engaging, conversational tone, the book is sensible, straightforward, and based on the experiences of hundreds of actual families. It will help all parents become calming authorities in their homes, bring peace to their families today, and give kids what they need to grow into caring, self-directed adults tomorrow.'

She reveals the new dynamics of creativity, taste, status, money, and the search for meaning in life. A judicious and juicy account of the institutions that have the power to shape art history, based on hundreds of interviews with high-profile players, Thornton's entertaining ethnography will change the way you look at contemporary culture. 8 illustrations"

S'Stephen King -- who has written more than fifty books, dozens of number one <I>New York Times</i> bestsellers, and many unforgettable movies -- delivers an astonishing collection of short stories, his first since <I>Everything\'s Eventual</i> six years ago. As guest editor of the bestselling <I>Best American Short Stories 2007</i>, King spent over a year reading hundreds of stories. His renewed passion for the form is evident on every page of <I>Just After Sunset</i>. The stories in this collection have appeared in <I>The New Yorker</i>, <I>Playboy</i>, <I>McSweeney\'s</i>, <I>The Paris Review</i>, <I>Esquire</i>, and other publications.  <P> Who but Stephen King would turn a Port-O-San into a slimy birth canal, or a roadside honky-tonk into a place for endless love? A book salesman with a grievance might pick up a mute hitchhiker, not knowing the silent man in the passenger seat listens altogether too well. Or an exercise routine on a stationary bicycle, begun to reduce bad cholesterol, might take its rider on a captivating -- and then terrifying -- journey. Set on a remote key in Florida, "The Gingerbread Girl" is a riveting tale featuring a young woman as vulnerable -- and resourceful -- as Audrey Hepburn\'s character in <I>Wait Until Dark</i>. In "Ayana," a blind girl works a miracle with a kiss and the touch of her hand. For King, the line between the living and the dead is often blurry, and the seams that hold our reality intact might tear apart at any moment. In one of the longer stories here, "N.," which recently broke new ground when it was adapted as a graphic digital entertainment, a psychiatric patient\'s irrational thinking might create an apocalyptic threat in the Maine countryside...or keep the world from falling victim to it.  <P> <I>Just After Sunset</i> -- call it dusk, call it twilight, it\'s a time when human intercourse takes on an unnatural cast, when nothing is quite as it appears, when the imagination begins to reach for shadows as they dissipate to darkness and living daylight can be scared right out of you. It\'s the perfect time for Stephen King.'

S'\x93The end was near.\x94 \x97Voices from the Zombie War<br><br>The Zombie War came unthinkably close to eradicating humanity. Max Brooks, driven by the urgency of preserving the acid-etched first-hand experiences of the survivors from those apocalyptic years, traveled across the United States of America and throughout the world, from decimated cities that once teemed with upwards of thirty million souls to the most remote and inhospitable areas of the planet. He recorded the testimony of men, women, and sometimes children who came face-to-face with the living, or at least the undead, hell of that dreadful time. <i>World War Z</i> is the result. Never before have we had access to a document that so powerfully conveys the depth of fear and horror, and also the ineradicable spirit of resistance, that gripped human society through the plague years.<br><br>Ranging from the now infamous village of New Dachang in the United Federation of China, where the epidemiological trail began with the twelve-year-old Patient Zero, to the unnamed northern forests where untold numbers sought a terrible and temporary refuge in the cold, to the United States of Southern Africa, where the Redeker Plan provided hope for humanity at an unspeakable price, to the west-of-the-Rockies redoubt where the North American tide finally started to turn, this invaluable chronicle reflects the full scope and duration of the Zombie War. <br><br>Most of all, the book captures with haunting immediacy the human dimension of this epochal event. Facing the often raw and vivid nature of these personal accounts requires a degree of courage on the part of the reader, but the effort is invaluable because, as Mr. Brooks says in his introduction, \x93By excluding the human factor, aren\x92t we risking the kind of personal detachment from history that may, heaven forbid, lead us one day to repeat it? And in the end, isn\x92t the human factor the only true difference between us and the enemy we now refer to as \x91the living dead\x92?\x94<br><br>Note: Some of the numerical and factual material contained in this edition was previously published under the auspices of the United Nations Postwar Commission.<br><br><br>Eyewitness reports from the first truly global war<br><br>\x93I found \x91Patient Zero\x92 behind the locked door of an abandoned apartment across town. . . .

They warned me not to touch him, that he was \x91cursed.\x92 I shrugged them off and reached for my mask and gloves. The boy\x92s skin was . . . cold and gray . . .

That\x92s what happened that day outside New York City, that\x92s the failure that almost lost us the whole damn war.

Like most practical women, Claire hardly expects her curiosity to get the better of her. But an ancient stone circle near her lodgings holds an eerie fascination, and when she innocently touches one of the giant boulders, she's hurtled backward in time more than two hundred years, to 1743.<P>Alone where no lady should be alone, and far from the familiar comforts of her other life, Claire's usual resourcefulness is tested to the limit. The merciless garrison captain so feared by others bears an uncanny resemblance to the husband she has just left behind. Her own odd circumstances expose her to accusations of witchcraft. And the strands of a political intrigue she doesn't understand threaten to ensnare her at every turn.<P>But of all the perils her new life holds, none is more disquieting than her growing feelings for James Fraser, the gallant young Scot she is forced to marry for her own protection. Sworn by his wedding vows to keep her from harm, Jamie's passion for Claire goes beyond duty. As she struggles with the memories of another lifetime, she is forced to make an agonizing and fateful choice, and learns ultimately that a man's instinct to protect the woman he loves is as old as time."

(S'The White Tiger: A Novel (Man Booker Prize)'
p6088
S'Introducing a major literary talent, <I>The White Tiger</i> offers a story of coruscating wit, blistering suspense, and questionable morality, told by the most volatile, captivating, and utterly inimitable narrator that this millennium has yet seen.<P>Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life -- having nothing but his own wits to help him along.<P>Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village\'s wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man\'s (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram\'s new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of <I>Murder Weekly</i> ("Love -- Rape -- Revenge!"), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive.<P>Balram\'s eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn\'t create virtue, and money doesn\'t solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations.<P>Sold in sixteen countries around the world, <I>The White Tiger</i> recalls <I>The Death of Vishnu</i> and <I>Bangkok 8</i> in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation -- and a startling, provocative debut.'

S"<I>New York Times</I> bestselling author Jodi Picoult is widely acclaimed for her keen insights into the hearts and minds of real people. Now she tells the emotionally riveting story of a family torn apart by conflicting needs and a passionate love that triumphs over human weakness. <P> Anna is not sick, but she might as well be. By age thirteen, she has undergone countless surgeries, transfusions, and shots so that her older sister, Kate, can somehow fight the leukemia that has plagued her since childhood. The product of preimplantation genetic diagnosis, Anna was conceived as a bone marrow match for Kate -- a life and a role that she has never challenged...until now. Like most teenagers, Anna is beginning to question who she truly is. But unlike most teenagers, she has always been defined in terms of her sister -- and so Anna makes a decision that for most would be unthinkable, a decision that will tear her family apart and have perhaps fatal consequences for the sister she loves. <P> <I>My Sister's Keeper</I> examines what it means to be a good parent, a good sister, a good person. Is it morally correct to do whatever it takes to save a child's life, even if that means infringing upon the rights of another? Is it worth trying to discover who you really are, if that quest makes you like yourself less? Should you follow your own heart, or let others lead you? Once again, in <I>My Sister's Keeper,</I> Jodi Picoult tackles a controversial real-life subject with grace, wisdom, and sensitivity."

Setting out for a year to study three different aspects of her nature amid   three different cultures, Gilbert explored the art of pleasure in Italy and the art of devotion in India,   and then a balance between the two on the Indonesian island of Bali.

His efforts are perfectly understandable because as he furiously scrambles, thousands of people he hasn't even met are trying to kill him. His problem is Colonel Cathcart, who keeps raising the number of missions the men must fly to complete their service. Yet if Yossarian makes any attempts to excuse himself from the perilous missions that he is committed to flying, he is trapped by the Great Loyalty Oath Crusade, the hilariously sinister bureaucratic rule from which the book takes its title: a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but if he makes the necessary formal request to be relieved of such missions, the very act of making the request proves that he is sane and therefore ineligible to be relieved. <P> <I>Catch-22</I> is a microcosm of the twentieth-century world as it might look to some one dangerously sane -- a masterpiece of our time."

Then they go back to those jobs with blackened eyes and loosened teeth and the sense that they can handle anything.

p6248
S"How anyone can be more effective with less effort by learning how to identify and leverage the 80/20 principle--the well-known, unpublicized secret that 80 percent of all our results in business and in life stem from a mere 20 percent of our efforts.<br><br>The 80/20 principle is one of the great secrets of highly effective people and organizations.<br><br>Did you know, for example, that 20 percent of customers account for 80 percent of revenues? That 20 percent of our time accounts for 80 percent of the work we accomplish? <b>The 80/20 Principle</b> shows how we can achieve much more with much less effort, time, and resources, simply by identifying and focusing our efforts on the 20 percent that really counts. Although the 80/20 principle has long influenced today's business world, author Richard Koch reveals how the principle works and shows how we can use it in a systematic and practical way to vastly increase our effectiveness, and improve our careers and our companies.<br><br>The unspoken corollary to the 80/20 principle is that little of what we spend our time on actually counts. But by concentrating on those things that do, we can unlock the enormous potential of the magic 20 percent, and transform our effectiveness in our jobs, our careers, our businesses, and our lives."

Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature."

p6347
S'"The fulfilled renown of Moby-Dick and of As I Lay Dying is augmented by Blood Meridian, since Cormac McCarthy is the worthy disciple both of Melville and Faulkner," writes esteemed literary scholar Harold Bloom in his Introduction to the Modern Library edition. "I venture that no other living American novelist, not even Pynchon, has given us a book as strong and memorable."<br><br>Cormac McCarthy\'s masterwork, Blood Meridian, chronicles the brutal world of the Texas-Mexico borderlands in the mid-nineteenth century. Its wounded hero, the teenage Kid, must confront the extraordinary violence of the Glanton gang, a murderous cadre on an official mission to scalp Indians and sell those scalps. Loosely based on fact, the novel represents a genius vision of the historical West, one so fiercely realized that since its initial publication in 1985 the canon of American literature has welcomed Blood Meridian to its shelf.<br>   <br>"A classic American novel of regeneration through violence," declares Michael Herr. "McCarthy can only be compared to our greatest writers."'

Not to mention her three intensely loyal Labs. But Fiona got to this point by surviving a nightmare...<BR><BR> Several years ago, Fiona was the only survivor of the Red Scarf serial killer, who shot and killed Fiona's cop fianc\xe9 and his K-9 partner. <BR><BR> On Orcas Island, Fiona found the peace and solitude she needed to rebuild her life. But all that changes on the day Simon Doyle barrels up her drive, desperate for her help. He's the reluctant owner of an out-of-control puppy, foisted upon him by his mother. Jaws has eaten through Simon's house, and he's at his wit's end. <BR><BR> To Fiona, Jaws is nothing she can't handle. Simon, however, is another matter. A newcomer to Orcas, he's a rugged and in-tensely private artist, known for the exquisite furniture he creates from wood. Simon never wanted a puppy-and he most definitely doesn't want a woman. Besides, the lanky redhead is not his type. But tell that to his hormones. <BR><BR> As Fiona embarks on training Jaws, and Simon begins to appreciate both dog and trainer, the past tears back into Fiona's life. A copycat killer has emerged out of the shadows, a man whose bloodlust has been channeled by a master with one motive: to reclaim the woman who slipped out of his hands..."

S'Design Drawing Book and CD - ROM Francis D.K. Ching with Steven P. Juroszek Author and architecture educator Francis D.K. Ching shares his unique command of visual language in this new presentation of drawing principles and techniques. Design Drawing is a comprehensive introduction to drawing and more-its innovative book-plus-CD-ROM package sheds new light on the relationship between perception, drawing, and design. In his distinctive graphic style, Ching takes us on an exciting journey through the process of creation. He unmasks the basic cognitive processes that drive visual perception and expression, incorporating observation, memory, and rendering into a creative whole. But the author sees drawing "not only as artistic expression but also as a practical tool for formulating and working through design problems," showing us how to apply "visual thinking" as a versatile tool for approaching design projects. Design Drawing covers the traditional basics of drawing, including line, shape, tone, and space. Different types of artistic conventions such as multiview, paraline, and perspective drawings are also lucidly explained. The final section, "Drawing from the Imagination," fuels the creative spirit to find its own direction. Throughout the book you\'ll find over a 1,500 hand-rendered drawings and exercises which reinforce the concepts and lessons of each chapter. The supplemental CD-ROM is packed with brilliant gems of information and instruction, elucidating a broad range of design drawing concepts through the communicative power of animation, video, and three-dimensional models. Intended for use with the book or as a stand-alone supplement, the CD-ROM includes 25 interactive lessons which demonstrate concepts and techniques in a way that a 2-D book format cannot. For example, the CD-ROM contains video of the author demonstrating freehand techniques in a step-by-step manner, as well as the author\'s voice throughout the CD-ROM explaining the various lessons. For professional architects, designers, fine artists, illustrators, teachers and students alike, this all-in-one package is both an effective tool and an outstanding value.

S'Happiness is something everyone desires. Yet how to find happiness\x96or even if we deserve to\x96remains a mystery. Still more mysterious is the secret to a lasting happiness that cannot be taken away. In <i>The Ultimate Happiness Prescription</i>, bestselling author Deepak Chopra shows us seven keys to uncover the true secrets of joy in the most difficult times.<br><br>The goal of life is the expansion of happiness, he contends. But in today\x92s demanding world, that goal seems elusive, if not impossibly out of reach. Society reinforces the belief that fulfillment comes from achieving success, wealth, and good relationships. Yet Chopra tells us that the opposite is true: all success in life is the by-product of happiness, not the cause.<br><br>So what is the cause? <i>The Ultimate Happiness Prescription</i> shares spiritual principles for a life based on a sense of your \x93true self\x94 lying beyond the ebb and flow of daily living. Simple daily exercises lead to eliminating the root causes of unhappiness and letting a deeper level of bliss unfold. <br><br>After all avenues to happiness have been explored and exhausted, only one path is left: the journey to enlightenment. In <i>The Ultimate Happiness Prescription</i>, the daunting and exotic challenge of finding enlightenment becomes accessible step by step. We are taken on an inspiring journey to the true self, the only place untouched by trouble and misfortune.<br> <br>On the way we learn the secrets for living mindfully and with effortless spontaneity. Now happiness is no longer hostage to external events but an experience we carry with us always. As Chopra inspiringly concludes, \x93Everything we fear in the world and want to change can be transformed through happiness, the simplest desire we have, and also the most profound.\x94'

It seems a young woman has disappeared, leaving murder in her wake, and it means everything to Rinaldo to track her down.

S'<P>On September 3, 2008 Alaska Governor Sarah Palin gave a speech at the Republican National Convention that electrified the nation and instantly made her one of the most recognizable women in the world.</P> <P> As chief executive of America?s largest state, she had built a record as a reformer who cast aside politics-as-usual and pushed through changes other politicians only talked about: Energy independence. Ethics reform. And the biggest private sector infrastructure project in U.S. history. While revitalizing public school funding and ensuring the state met its responsibilities to seniors and Alaska Native populations, Palin also beat the political "good ol? boys club" at their own game and brought Big Oil to heel. </P> <P> Like her GOP running mate, John McCain, Palin wasn?t a packaged and over-produced "candidate." She was a Main Street American woman: a working mom, wife of a blue collar union man, and mother of five children, the eldest of whom was serving his country in a yearlong deployment in Iraq and the youngest, an infant with special needs. Palin?s hometown story touched a populist nerve, rallying hundreds of thousands of ordinary Americans to the GOP ticket.</P> <P> But as the campaign unfolded, Palin became a lightning rod for both praise and criticism. Supporters called her "refreshing," "honest," a kitchen-table public servant they felt would fight for their interests. Opponents derided her as a wide-eyed Pollyanna unprepared for national leadership. But none of them knew the real Sarah Palin.</P> <P> In this eagerly anticipated memoir, Palin paints an intimate portrait of growing up in the wilds of Alaska; meeting her lifelong love; her decision to enter politics; the importance of faith and family; and the unique joys and trials of life as a high-profile working mother. She also opens up for the first time about the 2008 presidential race, providing a rare, mom?s-eye view of high-stakes national politics - from patriots dedicated to "Country First" to slick politicos bent on winning at any cost. </P> <P> Going Rogue traces one ordinary citizen?s extraordinary journey, and imparts Palin?s vision of a way forward for America and her unfailing hope in the greatest nation on earth.</P>'

S'An eye-opening, myth-shattering examination of what makes us fat, from acclaimed science writer Gary Taubes.<br><br>In his <i>New York Times</i> best seller, <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories,</i> Taubes argued that our diet\x92s overemphasis on certain kinds of carbohydrates\x97<i>not</i> fats and <i>not</i> simply excess calories\x97has led directly to the obesity epidemic we face today. The result of thorough research, keen insight, and unassailable common sense, <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> immediately stirred controversy and acclaim among academics, journalists, and writers alike. Michael Pollan heralded it as \x93a vitally important book, destined to change the way we think about food.\x94 <br><br>Building upon this critical work in <i>Good Calories, Bad Calories</i> and presenting fresh evidence for his claim, Taubes now revisits the urgent question of what\x92s making us fat\x97and how we can change\x97in this exciting new book. Persuasive, straightforward, and practical, <i>Why We Get Fat </i>makes Taubes\x92s crucial argument newly accessible to a wider audience.<br><br>Taubes reveals the bad nutritional science of the last century, none more damaging or misguided than the \x93calories-in, calories-out\x94 model of why we get fat, and the good science that has been ignored, especially regarding insulin\x92s regulation of our fat tissue. He also answers the most persistent questions: Why are some people thin and others fat? What roles do exercise and genetics play in our weight? What foods should we eat, and what foods should we avoid? <br><br>Packed with essential information and concluding with an easy-to-follow diet, <i>Why We Get Fat </i>is an invaluable key in our understanding of an international epidemic and a guide to what each of us can do about it.'

p6621
S'  In his million-copy bestseller <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I>, Jared Diamond examined how and   why Western civilizations developed the technologies and immunities that allowed them to   dominate much of the world. Now in this brilliant companion volume, Diamond probes the other   side of the equation: What caused some of the great civilizations of the past to collapse into ruin,   and what can we learn from their fates?  <P>  As in <I>Guns, Germs, and Steel</I>, Diamond weaves an all-encompassing global thesis   through a series of fascinating historical-cultural narratives. Moving from the Polynesian cultures   on Easter Island to the flourishing American civilizations of the Anasazi and the Maya and finally   to the doomed Viking colony on Greenland, Diamond traces the fundamental pattern of   catastrophe. Environmental damage, climate change, rapid population growth, and unwise   political choices were all factors in the demise of these societies, but other societies found   solutions and persisted. Similar problems face us today and have already brought disaster to   Rwanda and Haiti, even as China and Australia are trying to cope in innovative ways. Despite our   own society\x92s apparently inexhaustible wealth and unrivaled political power, ominous warning   signs have begun to emerge even in ecologically robust areas like Montana.<P>  Brilliant, illuminating, and immensely absorbing, <I>Collapse</I> is destined to take its place as   one of the essential books of our time, raising the urgent question: How can our world best avoid   committing ecological suicide?'

S"When seventeen-year-old Jane Taylor witnessed her father's death, something happened to her. Ever since, her thoughts have been consumed by death, going so far as to foresee the ever-changing deaths of those around her. Sixteen-year-old Emily Taylor resented her sister's closeness with their father, who died when she was six. With the strange ability to read minds, she drowns the voices out with drugs, sending Jane over the edge. When seventeen-year-old Wes Green was adopted, he moved in next door to Jane, finding in her a childhood friend turned high-school crush. All summer, the pain in his bones seemed unwarranted. He was done growing long ago. When senior year starts, however, the pain only gets worse. The foreseen changes are not expected, and far too animal for his taste. When Max Gordon found himself standing above the dying body of an innocent seven-year-old girl, he saw in her eyes something he hadn't seen in the century he'd spent roaming Earth. Her father was already dead, but there was hope to save her. Jane was her name, and already she was all he ever wanted. It was his job to bring her back, and it was his job to protect her - the biggest mistake of his life. When these four teens enter Glenwood High their senior year, no one but Max could understand the future ahead of them. Drawn together by blood and friendship, they each hide a dark secret that will soon bind them together. Max has to protect Jane, Jane wants to be normal, Wes wants Jane to love him, and Emily just wants the voices to stop... But their fate just wants them dead. "

We all have sins to confess.<br>\xa0<br>So reveals Catherine de Medici in this brilliantly imagined novel about one of history\x92s most powerful and controversial women. To some she was the ruthless queen who led France into an era of savage violence. To others she was the passionate savior of the French monarchy. Acclaimed author C. W. Gortner brings Catherine to life in her own voice, allowing us to enter into the intimate world of a woman whose determination to protect her family\x92s throne and realm plunged her into a lethal struggle for power.\xa0<br><br>\xa0The last legitimate descendant of the illustrious Medici line, Catherine suffers the expulsion of her family from her native Florence and narrowly escapes death at the hands of an enraged mob. While still a teenager, she is betrothed to Henri, son of Fran\xe7ois I of France, and sent from Italy to an unfamiliar realm where she is overshadowed and humiliated by her husband\x92s lifelong mistress. Ever resilient, Catherine strives to create a role for herself through her patronage of the famous clairvoyant Nostradamus and her own innate gift as a seer. But in her fortieth year, Catherine is widowed, left alone with six young children as regent of a kingdom torn apart by religious discord and the ambitions of a treacherous nobility.<br>\xa0<br>Relying on her tenacity, wit, and uncanny gift for compromise, Catherine seizes power, intent on securing the throne for her sons. She allies herself with the enigmatic Protestant leader Coligny, with whom she shares an intimate secret, and implacably carves a path toward peace, unaware that her own dark fate looms before her\x97a fate that, if she is to save France, will demand the sacrifice of her ideals, her reputation, and the passion of her embattled heart.\xa0<br><br>From the fairy-tale ch\xe2teaux of the Loire Valley to the battlefields of the wars of religion to the mob-filled streets of Paris, The Confessions of Catherine de Medici is the extraordinary untold journey of one of the most maligned and misunderstood women ever to be queen.<br>\xa0'

S'<p> Which is more dangerous, a gun or a swimming pool? What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? How did the legalization of abortion affect the rate of violent crime? </p> <p> These may not sound like typical questions for an econo-mist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much-heralded scholar who studies the riddles of everyday life\x97from cheating and crime to sports and child-rearing\x97and whose conclusions turn conventional wisdom on its head. </p> <p> <i>Freakonomics</i> is a groundbreaking collaboration between Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner, an award-winning author and journalist. They usually begin with a mountain of data and a simple question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics. </p> <p> Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives\x97how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In <i>Freakonomics</i>, they explore the hidden side of . . . well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Klu Klux Klan. </p> <p> What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a great deal of complexity and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and\x97if the right questions are asked\x97is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. </p> <p> <i>Freakonomics</i> establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But <i>Freakonomics</i> can provide more than that. It will literally redefine the way we view the modern world. </p>'

(S'When Technology Fails (Revised & Expanded): A Manual for Self-Reliance, Sustainability, and Surviving the Long Emergency'
p6725
S'There\x92s never been a better time to \x93be prepared.\x94 Matthew Stein\x92s comprehensive primer on sustainable living skills\x97from food and water to shelter and energy to first-aid and crisis-management skills\x97prepares you to embark on the path toward sustainability. But unlike any other book, Stein not only shows you how to live \x93green\x94 in seemingly stable times, but to live in the face of potential disasters, lasting days or years, coming in the form of social upheaval, economic meltdown, or environmental catastrophe.</p><i>When Technology Fails</i> covers the gamut. You\x92ll learn how to start a fire and keep warm if you\x92ve been left temporarily homeless, as well as the basics of installing a renewable energy system for your home or business. You\x92ll learn how to find and sterilize water in the face of utility failure, as well as practical information for dealing with water-quality issues even when the public tap water is still flowing. You\x92ll learn alternative techniques for healing equally suited to an era of profit-driven malpractice as to situations of social calamity. Each chapter (a survey of the risks to the status quo; supplies and preparation for short- and long-term emergencies; emergency measures for survival; water; food; shelter; clothing; first aid, low-tech medicine, and healing; energy, heat, and power; metalworking; utensils and storage; low-tech chemistry; and engineering, machines, and materials) offers the same approach, describing skills for self-reliance in good times and bad.</p>Fully revised and expanded\x97the first edition was written pre-9/11 and pre-Katrina, when few Americans took the risk of social disruption seriously\x97<i>When Technology Fails</i> ends on a positive, proactive note with a new chapter on "Making the Shift to Sustainability," which offers practical suggestions for changing our world on personal, community and global levels.<br><br>'

S"Oliver Stone and the Camel Club return in #1 bestselling author David Baldacci's most stunning adventure yet.</br></br><i  >An attack on the heart of power . . . </i></br></br><i  >In sight of the White House . . . </i></br></br><i  >At a place known as . . . </i></br></br><b  >HELL'S CORNER</b></br></br> John Carr, aka Oliver Stone-once the most skilled assassin his country ever had-stands in Lafayette Park in front of the White House, perhaps for the last time. The president has personally requested that Stone serve his country again on a high-risk, covert mission. Though he's fought for decades to leave his past career behind, Stone has no choice but to say yes.</br></br> Then Stone's mission changes drastically before it even begins. It's the night of a state dinner honoring the British prime minister. As he watches the prime minister's motorcade leave the White House that evening, a bomb is detonated in Lafayette Park, an apparent terrorist attack against both leaders. It's in the chaotic aftermath that Stone takes on a new, more urgent assignment: find those responsible for the bombing.</br></br> British MI-6 agent Mary Chapman becomes Stone's partner in the search for the unknown attackers. But their opponents are elusive, capable, and increasingly lethal; worst of all, it seems that the park bombing may just have been the opening salvo in their plan. With nowhere else to turn, Stone enlists the help of the only people he knows he can trust: the Camel Club. Yet that may be a big mistake.</br></br> In the shadowy worlds of politics and intelligence, there is no one you can really trust. Nothing is really what it seems to be. And Hell's Corner truly lives up to its name. This may be Oliver Stone's and the Camel Club's last stand."

p6765
S"<DIV><p>Some teachers love grammar and some hate it, but nearly all struggle to find ways of making the mechanics of English meaningful to kids. As a middle school teacher, Jeff Anderson also discovered that his students were not grasping the basics, and that it was preventing them from reaching their potential as writers. Jeff readily admits, \x93I am not a grammarian, nor am I punctilious about anything,\x94 so he began researching and testing the ideas of scores of grammar experts in his classroom, gradually finding successful ways of integrating grammar instruction into writer's workshop.</p><p><I>Mechanically Inclined</I> is the culmination of years of experimentation that merges the best of writer's workshop elements with relevant theory about how and why skills should be taught. It connects theory about using grammar in context with practical instructional strategies, explains why kids often don't understand or apply grammar and mechanics correctly, focuses on attending to the \x93high payoff,\x94 or most common errors in student writing, and shows how to carefully construct a workshop environment that can best support grammar and mechanics concepts. Jeff emphasizes four key elements in his teaching:<ul><li>short daily instruction in grammar and mechanics within writer's workshop;</li><li>using high-quality mentor texts to teach grammar and mechanics in context;</li><li>visual scaffolds, including wall charts, and visual cues that can be pasted into writer's notebooks;</li><li>regular, short routines, like \x93express-lane edits,\x94 that help students spot and correct errors automatically.</li></ul><p>Comprising an overview of the research-based context for grammar instruction, a series of over thirty detailed lessons, and an appendix of helpful forms and instructional tools, <I>Mechanically Inclined</I> is a boon to teachers regardless of their level of grammar-phobia. It shifts the negative, rule-plagued emphasis of much grammar instruction into one which celebrates the power and beauty these tools have in shaping all forms of writing.</p></DIV>"

S'Stephen Sondheim has won seven Tonys, an Academy Award, seven Grammys, a Pulitzer Prize and the Kennedy Center Honors. His career has spanned more than half a century, his lyrics have become synonymous with musical theater and popular culture, and in <i>Finishing the Hat</i>\x97titled after perhaps his most autobiographical song, from <i>Sunday in the Park with George</i>\x97Sondheim has not only collected his lyrics for the first time, he is giving readers a rare personal look into his life as well as his remarkable productions.<br><br>Along with the lyrics for all of his musicals from 1954 to 1981\x97including <i>West Side Story, Company, Follies, A Little Night Music</i> and <i>Sweeney Todd</i>\x97Sondheim treats us to never-before-published songs from each show, songs that were cut or discarded before seeing the light of day. He discusses his relationship with his mentor, Oscar Hammerstein II, and his collaborations with extraordinary talents such as Leonard Bernstein, Arthur Laurents, Ethel Merman, Richard Rodgers, Angela Lansbury, Harold Prince and a panoply of others. The anecdotes\x97filled with history, pointed observations and intimate details\x97transport us back to a time when theater was a major pillar of American culture. Best of all, Sondheim appraises his work and dissects his lyrics, as well as those of others, offering unparalleled insights into songwriting that will be studied by fans and aspiring songwriters for years to come. <br><br>Accompanying Sondheim\x92s sparkling writing are behind-the-scenes photographs from each production, along with handwritten music and lyrics from the songwriter\x92s personal collection. <br><br>Penetrating and surprising, poignant, funny and sometimes provocative, <i>Finishing the Hat</i> is not only an informative look at the art and craft of lyric writing, it is a history of the theater that belongs on the same literary shelf as Moss Hart\x92s <i>Act One</i> and Arthur Miller\x92s <i>Timebends</i>.

S'From two of our most fiercely moral voices, a passionate call to arms against our era\x92s most pervasive human rights violation: the oppression of women and girls in the developing world.<br><br>With Pulitzer Prize winners Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn as our guides, we undertake an odyssey through Africa and Asia to meet the extraordinary women struggling there, among them a Cambodian teenager sold into sex slavery and an Ethiopian woman who suffered devastating injuries in childbirth. Drawing on the breadth of their combined reporting experience, Kristof and WuDunn depict our world with anger, sadness, clarity, and, ultimately, hope.<br><br>They show how a little help can transform the lives of women and girls abroad. That Cambodian girl eventually escaped from her brothel and, with assistance from an aid group, built a thriving retail business that supports her family. The Ethiopian woman had her injuries repaired and in time became a surgeon. A Zimbabwean mother of five, counseled to return to school, earned her doctorate and became an expert on AIDS.<br><br>Through these stories, Kristof and WuDunn help us see that the key to economic progress lies in unleashing women\x92s potential. They make clear how so many people have helped to do just that, and how we can each do our part. Throughout much of the world, the greatest unexploited economic resource is the female half of the population. Countries such as China have prospered precisely because they emancipated women and brought them into the formal economy. Unleashing that process globally is not only the right thing to do; it\x92s also the best strategy for fighting poverty.<br><br>Deeply felt, pragmatic, and inspirational, <i>Half the Sky</i> is essential reading for every global citizen.'

Theyre dog-eat-dog battlegrounds in which kids must set aside interests and passions in order to strategize over how to game the system. In this increasingly stressful environment, kids arent defined by their character or hunger for knowledge, but by often arbitrary scores and statistics. In The Overachievers, journalist Alexandra Robbins delivers a poignant, funny, riveting narrative that explores how our high-stakes educational culture has spiraled out of control. During the year of her ten-year reunion, Robbins returns to her high school, where she follows students including CJ and others: -- Julie, a track and academic star who is terrified she\'s making the wrong choices -- "AP" Frank, who grapples with horrifying parental pressure to succeed -- Taylor, a soccer and lacrosse captain whose ambition threatens her popular girl status -- Sam, who worries his years of overachieving will be wasted if he doesnt attend a name-brand college -- Audrey, who struggles with perfectionism, and -- The Stealth Overachiever, a mystery junior who flies under the radar. Robbins tackles hard-hitting issues such as the student and teacher cheating epidemic, over-testing, sports rage, the black market for study drugs, and a college admissions process so cutthroat that some students are driven to depression and suicide because of a B. Even the earliest years of schooling have become insanely competitive, as Robbins learned when she gained unprecedented access into the inner workings of a prestigious Manhattan kindergarten admissions office. A compelling mix of fast-paced storytelling and engrossing investigative journalism, The Overachievers aims both to calm the admissions frenzy and to expose its escalating dangers.'

S'  <I>Should I really read to my baby? Is all TV bad, or only some TV?  What kind   of toys   do babies need? Can teaching a baby sign language really boost IQ? How should my   caregiver be stimulating my baby? Should I pipe classical music into the   nursery?</I>  <BR><BR>  New parents are often overwhelmed with information and advice, and in an effort   to give   their babies the best chances in life they buy DVDs, CDs, toys, and gear all   meant to   make them smarter.  As co-founder of New Directions Institute for Infant Brain   Development, Dr. Jill Stamm knows what most parents and child caregivers   suspect: the   way we care for a very young child\x92s developing brain has the power to shape and   influence many aspects of his or her life.  Contrary, however, to the belief   that the "right   things" can make your child a genius, the research shows that what your child   needs is   simpler than you think and within every parent\x92s ability to provide.   In   <I>Bright from   the Start</I>, Jill translates the latest neuroscience findings into clear   explanations and   practical suggestions, showing you the importance of the simple ways you   interact with   your child every day. A leading authority in infant brain development, Dr. Stamm   makes   new, remarkable findings accessible to everyone in <I>Bright from the Start</I>.    What   babies need isn\x92t a lot of "edu-tainment." What they need is as easy as A, B, C:  <BR><BR>  ATTENTION: showing you how to increase a child\x92s attention span, and how to   balance   stimulation with down time.<BR>  BONDING: illustrating the importance of developing a strong emotional   attachment   between a child and a consistent caregiver\x97and why this is key to cognitive   development.<BR>  COMMUNICATION: with breakthrough advice for tapping the connection between   verbal engagement with parents and higher IQ rates among children.  <BR><BR>  Stamm also discusses what kind of childcare environment to select, why learning   toys   don\x92t teach as much as you think, why reading to baby is critical and why you   should   limit TV time.  Practical games and tips for each developmental age group will   show you   not only what the latest findings are but more importantly, tell you what to do   with them.'

S'<p>After being dumped by his longtime girlfriend, twenty-eight-year-old Justin Halpern found himself living at home with his seventy-three-year-old dad. Sam Halpern, who is "like Socrates, but angrier, and with worse hair," has never minced words, and when Justin moved back home, he began to record all the ridiculous things his dad said to him: </p> <blockquote> <p> "That woman was sexy. . . . Out of your league? Son, let women figure out why they won\'t screw you. Don\'t do it for them." </p> <p> "Do people your age know how to comb their hair? It looks like two squirrels crawled on their heads and started fucking." </p> <p> "The worst thing you can be is a liar. . . . Okay, fine, yes, the worst thing you can be is a Nazi, but then number two is liar. Nazi one, liar two." </p> </blockquote> <p> More than a million people now follow Mr. Halpern\'s philosophical musings on Twitter, and in this book, his son weaves a brilliantly funny, touching coming-of-age memoir around the best of his quotes. An all-American story that unfolds on the Little League field, in Denny\'s, during excruciating family road trips, and, most frequently, in the Halperns\' kitchen over bowls of Grape-Nuts, <i>Sh*t My Dad Says</i> is a chaotic, hilarious, true portrait of a father-son relationship from a major new comic voice. </p>    <br/><hr noshade="noshade" size="1" class="bucketDivider"/>'

Why do women tend to form deeper bonds with their female friends than men do with their male counterparts? These and other questions have stumped both sexes throughout the ages. <br><br>Now, pioneering neuropsychiatrist Louann Brizendine, M.D., brings together the latest findings to show how the unique structure of the female brain determines how women think, what they value, how they communicate, and who they love. While doing research as a medical student at Yale and then as a resident and faculty member at Harvard, Louann Brizendine discovered that almost all of the clinical data in existence on neurology, psychology, and neurobiology focused exclusively on males. In response to the overwhelming need for information on the female mind, Brizendine established the first clinic in the country to study and treat women\x92s brain function. <br><br>In <i>The Female Brain</i>, Dr. Brizendine distills all her findings and the latest information from the scientific community in a highly accessible book that educates women about their unique brain/body/behavior. <br><br>The result: women will come away from this book knowing that they have a lean, mean, communicating machine.

p6935
S'<p> Richard A. Clarke warned America once before about the havoc terrorism would wreak on our national security -- and he was right. Now he warns us of another threat, silent but equally dangerous. <i>Cyber War</i> is a powerful book about technology, government, and military strategy; about criminals, spies, soldiers, and hackers. This is the first book about the war of the future -- cyber war -- and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it. </p> <p> <i>Cyber War</i> goes behind the "geek talk" of hackers and computer scientists to explain clearly and convincingly what cyber war is, how cyber weapons work, and how vulnerable we are as a nation and as individuals to the vast and looming web of cyber criminals. From the first cyber crisis meeting in the White House a decade ago to the boardrooms of Silicon Valley and the electrical tunnels under Manhattan, Clarke and coauthor Robert K. Knake trace the rise of the cyber age and profile the unlikely characters and places at the epicenter of the battlefield. They recount the foreign cyber spies who hacked into the office of the Secretary of Defense, the control systems for U.S. electric power grids, and the plans to protect America\'s latest fighter aircraft. </p> <p> Economically and militarily, Clarke and Knake argue, what we\'ve already lost in the new millennium\'s cyber battles is tantamount to the Soviet and Chinese theft of our nuclear bomb secrets in the 1940s and 1950s. The possibilities of what we stand to lose in an all-out cyber war -- our individual and national security among them -- are just as chilling. Powerful and convincing, <i>Cyber War</i> begins the critical debate about the next great threat to national security. </p>'

p6945
S"Discipleship is costly. Are we willing to critique and even challenge much we've been taught for the sake of the kingdom? For this is the radical nature of the discipleship to which Jesus calls us. He did not allow the outside culture to hold him captive; instead he established the kingdom of God and turned the world on its head. Jesus was untamed, and he calls his church to be the same.    In this provocative and compelling book, internationally known missiologists Alan and Debra Hirsch overthrow culturized understandings of theology and culture, and cast a vision for a distinctly mission-shaped way of living the Christian life. Written for any Christian serious about issue of discipleship, Untamed covers such topics as church, humans as bearers of the image of God, family life, culture, and sexuality. Through it all they seek to answer the question, how are we to think and live day to day as followers of Jesus?    Each chapter ends with suggested practices to help readers begin to live out the book's principles as well as questions for group discussion."

(S"Fortune's Formula: The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System"
p6950
S'<div>In 1956 two Bell Labs scientists discovered the scientific formula for getting rich. One was mathematician Claude Shannon, neurotic father of our digital age, whose genius is ranked with Einstein\'s. The other was John L. Kelly Jr., a Texas-born, gun-toting physicist. Together they applied the science of information theory--the basis of computers and the Internet--to the problem of making as much money as possible, as fast as possible.<br><br>Shannon and MIT mathematician Edward O. Thorp took the "Kelly formula" to Las Vegas. It worked. They realized that there was even more money to be made in the stock market. Thorp used the Kelly system with his phenomenonally successful hedge fund, Princeton-Newport Partners. Shannon became a successful investor, too, topping even Warren Buffett\'s rate of return. <i>Fortune\'s Formula </i>traces how the Kelly formula sparked controversy<i> </i>even as it made fortunes at racetracks, casinos, and trading<i> </i>desks. It reveals the dark side of this alluring scheme, which is<i> </i>founded on exploiting an insider\'s edge.<br><i></i><br>Shannon believed it was possible for a smart investor to beat<i> </i>the market--and <i>Fortune\'s Formula </i>will convince you that he was right.<br></div>'

S"Renowned professor and author Gilbert Strang demonstrates that linear algebra is a fascinating subject by showing both its beauty and value. While the mathematics is there, the effort is not all concentrated on proofs. Strang's emphasis is on understanding. He explains concepts, rather than deduces. This book is written in an informal and personal style and teaches real mathematics. The gears change in Chapter 2 as students reach the introduction of vector spaces. Throughout the book, the theory is motivated and reinforced by genuine applications, allowing pure mathematicians to teach applied mathematics."

But once the first daring mariners successfully navigated to far shores\x97whether it was the Vikings, the Irish, the Chinese, Christopher Columbus in the north, or the Portuguese and the Spanish in the south\x97the Atlantic evolved in the world's growing consciousness of itself as an enclosed body of water bounded by the Americas to the West, and by Europe and Africa to the East. <I>Atlantic</I> is a biography of this immense space, of a sea which has defined and determined so much about the lives of the millions who live beside or near its tens of thousands of miles of coast. </P> <P>The Atlantic has been central to the ambitions of explorers, scientists and warriors, and it continues to affect our character, attitudes, and dreams.

p6990
S'<DIV>We\'re living in the Age of Persuasion. Leaders and organizations of all kinds--public and private, large and small--fulfill their missions only by competing in the marketplace of images and messages. To win in that marketplace, they need advertising. This has been true since the advent of mass media, from mass-circulation magazines and radio through the age of television and the Internet.<BR><BR>Yet even as they use advertising to capture consumers\' imaginations and build their brands, few people know of the ingenious and tormented man who built the modern advertising industry and shaped a new consumer sensibility as the twentieth century unfolded: Albert D. Lasker.<BR><BR>Drawing on a recently uncovered trove of Lasker\'s papers, Jeffrey Cruikshank and Arthur Schultz have written a fascinating biography of one of the past century\'s most influential, intriguing, troubled, and instructive figures. Lasker\'s creative and powerful use of "reason-why" advertising to inject ideas and arguments into ad campaigns had a profound impact on modern advertising, foreshadowing the consumer-centered "unique selling proposition" approach that dominates the industry today. His tactics helped launch or revitalize companies and brands that remain household names--including Palmolive, Goodyear, and Quaker Oats.<BR><BR>As Lasker rose in prominence, he went beyond consumer products to apply his brilliance to presidential politics, government service, and professional sports, changing the game wherever he went, and building a vast fortune along the way. But his intensity had a price--he was felled by mental breakdowns throughout his life. This book also tells the story of how he fought back with determination and with support from family and friends in an age when lack of effective treatment doomed most mentally ill people.<BR><BR>The Man Who Sold America is a riveting account of a man larger than life, who shaped not only an industry but also a century.<BR></DIV>'

p7000
S'A black swan is a highly improbable event with three principal characteristics: It is unpredictable; it carries a massive impact; and, after the fact, we concoct an explanation that makes it appear less random, and more predictable, than it was. The astonishing success of Google was a black swan; so was 9/11. For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br><br>Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don\x92t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the \x93impossible.\x94<br><br>For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do. We restrict our thinking to the irrelevant and inconsequential, while large events continue to surprise us and shape our world. Now, in this revelatory book, Taleb explains everything we know about what we don\x92t know. He offers surprisingly simple tricks for dealing with black swans and benefiting from them.<br><br>Elegant, startling, and universal in its applications <b>The Black Swan</b> will change the way you look at the world. Taleb is a vastly entertaining writer, with wit, irreverence, and unusual stories to tell. He has a polymathic command of subjects ranging from cognitive science to business to probability theory. <b>The Black Swan </b>is a landmark book\x96itself a black swan. <br><br><br><b>*2nd Edition, With a new essay: "On Robustness and Fragility"</b><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7015
S'Toddlers can drive you bonkers\x85so adorable and fun one minute\x85so stubborn and demanding the next! Yet, as unbelievable as it sounds, there is a way to turn the daily stream of \x93nos\x94 and \x93don\x92ts\x94 into \x93yeses\x94 and hugs\x85if you know how to speak your toddler\x92s language. In one of the most useful advances in parenting techniques of the past twenty-five years, Dr. Karp reveals that toddlers, with their immature brains and stormy outbursts, should be thought of not as pint-size people but as pintsize\x85cavemen. <br><br>Having noticed that the usual techniques often failed to calm crying toddlers, Dr. Karp discovered that the key to effective communication was to speak to them in their own primitive language. When he did, suddenly he was able to soothe their outbursts almost every time! This amazing success led him to the realization that children between the ages of one and four go through four stages of \x93evolutionary\x94 growth, each linked to the development of the brain, and each echoing a step in prehistoric humankind\x92s journey to civilization:<br><br>\x95 The \x93Charming Chimp-Child\x94 (12 to 18 months): Wobbles around on two legs, grabs everything in reach, plays a nonstop game of \x93monkey see monkey do.\x94<br>\x95 The \x93Knee-High Neanderthal\x94 (18 to 24 months): Strong-willed, fun-loving, messy, with a vocabulary of about thirty words, the favorites being \x93no\x94 and \x93mine.\x94<br>\x95 The \x93Clever Caveman\x94 (24 to 36 months): <br>Just beginning to learn how to share, make friends, take turns, and use the potty.<br>\x95 The \x93Versatile Villager\x94 (36 to 48 months): Loves to tell stories, sing songs and dance, while trying hard to behave.<br><br>To speak to these children, Dr. Karp has developed two extraordinarily effective techniques:<br>1) The \x93fast food\x94 rule\x97restating what your child has said to make sure you got it right;<br>2) The four-step rule\x97using gesture, repetition, simplicity, and tone to help your <br>irate Stone-Ager be happy again.<br><br>Once you\x92ve mastered \x93toddler-ese,\x94 you will be ready to apply behavioral techniques specific to each stage of your child\x92s development, such as teaching patience and calm, doing time-outs (and time-ins), praise through \x93gossiping,\x94 and many other strategies. Then all the major challenges of the toddler years\x97including separation anxiety, sibling rivalry, toilet training, night fears, sleep problems, picky eating, biting and hitting, medicine taking <i>\x97 </i>can be handled in a way that will make your toddler feel understood. The result: fewer tantrums, less yelling, and, best of all, more happy, loving time for you and your child.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S"June 6th, 2267 - A life-pod, missed by rescuers following the mysterious explosion of a Space Command vessel a decade earlier, is discovered by a passing freighter in deep space. A young officer, still cocooned in stasis sleep, is found inside. When revived, Ensign Jenetta Carver learns of the lawlessness that now suffuses interstellar space.  Pirates and slavers seem able to attack and pillage with impunity. Space Command has committed its full resources to stopping the anarchy, but criminal groups have grown immensely powerful.<br>  <br>Although determined to rejoin SC as soon as possible, Jenetta is captured by pirates before that can happen. At first she fears for her life, but when she's indelibly marked as a pleasure slave, she gets mad; fighting mad. And when they tamper with her DNA to make her appear sexier, she gets even madder; killing mad.<br>  <br>Can a petite blonde, cut off from Space Command, create more mayhem among the criminal elements than a full decade of SC effort? You'd better believe it!<br>  <br>  <br>From the back cover:<br>    <br>For all of her young life, Jenetta Carver had dreamed of cruising between the stars in a powerful spaceship, but nothing in her visions of a bright future even remotely resembled the perilous situation she now faced.<br>  <br>Lt.

Though an anxious look swathed her face, there was unmistakable resoluteness in her voice. <br>  <br>Jenetta breathed in deeply and then released it before answering in a voice lowered so that it only carried to her XO. \x93We\x92re going to have to slash and burn,\x94 she replied.<br>  <br>\x93Slash and burn?\x94 Gloria questioned, equally sotto voce.<br>  <br>\x93We don\x92t yet know what we\x92re facing, so we can\x92t prepare anything tactically sophisticated.

(S'Results Now: How We Can Achieve Unprecedented Improvements in Teaching and Learning'
p7122
S'<P>According to author Mike Schmoker, there is a yawning gap between the most well-known essential practices and the reality of most classrooms. This gap persists despite the hard, often heroic work done by many teachers and administrators. Schmoker believes that teachers and administrators may know what the best practices are, but they aren\x92t using them or reinforcing them consistently. He asserts that our schools are protected by a buffer\x97a protective barrier that prevents scrutiny of instruction by outsiders. The buffer exists within the school as well. Teachers often know only what is going on in their classrooms\x97and they may be completely in the dark about what other teachers in the school are doing. Even principals, says Schmoker, don\x92t have a clear view of the daily practices of teaching and learning in their schools.<P>Schmoker suggests that we need to get beyond this buffer to confront the truth about what is happening in classrooms, and to allow teachers to learn from each other and to be supervised properly. He outlines a plan that focuses on the importance of consistent curriculum, authentic literacy education, and professional learning communities for teachers.<P>What will students get out of this new approach? Learning for life. Schmoker argues passionately that students become learners for life when they have more opportunities to engage in strategic reading, writing with explicit guidance, and argument and discussion.<P>Through strong teamwork, true leadership, and authentic learning, schools and their students can reach new heights. Results Now is a rally cry for educators to focus on what counts. If they do, Schmoker promises, the entire school community can count on unprecedented achievements.'

Augustine    <P>Much is said in Christian circles about knowing God. But Christians throughout the ages have agreed that there cannot be deep knowledge of God without deep knowledge of the self. Discerning your true self is inextricably related to discerning God\'s purposes for you. Paradoxically, the more you become like Christ, the more you become authentically yourself.    <P>In this profound exploration of Christian identity, psychologist and spiritual director David G. Benner illuminates the spirituality of self-discovery. He exposes the false selves that you may hide behind and calls you to discover the true self that emerges from your uniqueness in Christ. Freeing you from illusions about yourself, Benner shows that self-understanding leads to the fulfillment of your God-given destiny and vocation.    <P>"Christian spirituality," writes Benner, "involves a transformation of the self that occurs only when God and self are both deeply known." The self is not God, but it is the place where you meet God. Genuine self-knowledge revitalizes your spiritual life and opens the door to becoming who God has created you to be.    <P>Rest assured, you need not try to be someone you are not.    <P>But you will deepen your experience of God through discovering the gift of being yourself.'

(S'The Great Reset: How New Ways of Living and Working Drive Post-Crash Prosperity'
p7170
S'<p>We tend to view prolonged economic downturns, such as the Great Depression of the 1930s and the Long Depression of the late nineteenth century, in terms of the crisis and pain they cause. But history teaches us that these great crises also represent opportunities to remake our economy and society and to generate whole new eras of economic growth and prosperity. In terms of innovation, invention, and energetic risk taking, these periods of "creative destruction" have been some of the most fertile in history, and the changes they put into motion can set the stage for full-scale recovery. </p><p>In <i>The Great Reset</i>, bestselling author and economic development expert Richard Florida provides an engaging and sweeping examination of these previous economic epochs, or "resets." He distills the deep forces that have altered physical and social landscapes and eventually reshaped economies and societies. Looking toward the future, Florida identifies the patterns that will drive the next Great Reset and transform virtually every aspect of our lives\x97from how and where we live, to how we work, to how we invest in individuals and infrastructure, to how we shape our cities and regions. Florida shows how these forces, when combined, will spur a fresh era of growth and prosperity, define a new geography of progress, and create surprising opportunities for all of us. Among these forces will be</p><ul><li>new patterns of consumption, and new attitudes toward ownership that are less centered on houses and cars</li><li>the transformation of millions of service jobs into middle class careers that engage workers as a source of innovation</li><li>new forms of infrastructure that speed the movement of people, goods, and ideas</li><li>a radically altered and much denser economic landscape organized around "megaregions" that will drive the development of new industries, new jobs, and a whole new way of life</li></ul><p>We\'ve weathered tough times before. They are a necessary part of economic cycles, giving us a chance to clearly see what\'s working and what\'s not. Societies can be reborn in such crises, emerging fresh, strong, and refocused. Now is our opportunity to anticipate what that brighter future will look like and to take the steps that will get us there faster.</p><p></p><p>With his trademark blend of wit, irreverence, and rigorous research and analysis, Florida presents an optimistic and counterintuitive vision of our future, calling into question long-held beliefs about the nature of economic progress and forcing us to reassess our very way of life. He argues convincingly that it\'s time to turn our efforts\x97as individuals, as governments, and as a society\x97to putting the necessary pieces in place for a vibrant, prosperous future. </p>'

p7175
S'<strong>The classic Existentialist novel, with a new introduction by renowned poet, translator, and critic Richard Howard.</strong>  Winner of the 1964 Nobel Prize for Literature, Jean-Paul Sartre, French  philosopher, critic, novelist, and dramatist, holds a position of  singular eminence in the world of letters. Among readers and critics  familiar with the whole of Sartre\'s work, it is generally recognized  that his earliest novel, <em>La Naus\xe9e</em> (first published in 1938), is  his finest and most significant. It is unquestionably a key novel of the  twentieth century and a landmark in Existentialist fiction.<br />  <br />  <em>Nausea</em>  is the story of Antoine Roquentin, a French writer who is horrified at  his own existence. In impressionistic, diary form he ruthlessly  catalogues his every feeling and sensation. His thoughts culminate in a  pervasive, overpowering feeling of nausea which "spreads at the bottom  of the viscous puddle, at the bottom of our time\x97the time of purple  suspenders and broken chair seats; it is made of wide, soft instants,  spreading at the edge, like an oil stain." Roquentin\'s efforts to come  to terms with life, his philosophical and psychological struggles, give  Sartre the opportunity to dramatize the tenets of his Existentialist  creed.'

(S'Eat This, Not That! Thousands of Simple Food Swaps that Can Save You 10, 20, 30 Pounds--or More!'
p7205
S"Eat what you want, when you want--and watch the pounds disappear!     <P>Americans spend more than $400 billion a year eating out, and behind each burger, turkey sandwich, and ice cream sundae is a simple decision that could help you control your weight--and your life. The problem is, restaurant chains and food producers aren't interested in helping you make healthy choices. In fact, they invest $30 billion a year on advertising, much of it aimed at confusing eaters and disguising the fat and calorie counts of their products.    <P>All of that has changed with EAT THIS, NOT THAT!. This book puts the entire food industry under the spotlight, and arms you with the savvy tricks and insider information it takes to eat well no matter where you are. With EAT THIS, NOT THAT! you're the expert in every eating situation, from the frozen food aisle to your favorite fast food joint to your local sports bar. You control your food universe--and lose the pounds you want--because, unlike every other customer, you'll know the smart choices to make--instantly!     <P>EAT THIS, NOT THAT! is jam-packed with secrets the restaurant industry doesn't want you to know. For example:   * Burger King doesn't want you to know that a BK Big Fish\xae Sandwich and fries have a whopping 1000 calories--nearly half your daily caloric intake! (Fish is usually healthy, but not this kind. Find out why with this book.)   * Pizza Hut doesn't want you to know that a standard pizza in Italy contains 500 to 800 calories, but the same meal at Pizza Hut can top 2,100 calories! (You'd need to ride a stationary bike for more than three hours to burn off this mistake. Instead, eat all the pizza you want by making smart choices. EAT THIS, NOT THAT! shows you how.)   * Macaroni Grill doesn't want you to know that a single serving of their Grilled Teriyaki Salmon has more than three times your daily allowance of sodium! (Cut your risk of high blood pressure by making smart choices at the same restaurant. You'll find them inside.)     <P>If only you knew the industry secrets, you could eat at any of your favorite restaurants--or chow down on everything from the company vending machine to your kids' Halloween buckets--and know that every decision you made was smart, healthy, and the best possible choice for you. For example, did you know:   * At McDonald's, an Egg McMuffin\xae is actually a healthy choice, with just 300 calories. (The Hotcakes pack more than double that amount!)   * At Krispy Kreme, all you need to do is order the Very Berry Chiller instead of the Mocha Dream Chiller, and you'll save 500 calories! (Do that once a week and you'll drop more than 7 pounds this year--without trying!)   * At Chipotle, you can cut 570 calories out of your Chicken Burrito just by ordering it as a bowl (without the tortilla) and asking them to hold the rice. (Same great taste, but with 94 fewer carb grams!)   * Choosing a cinnamon roll at Au Bon Pain over Cinnabon will save you 463 calories and 20 grams of fat!   * In the freezer section of your local supermarket, a turkey pot pie from Swanson's has 610 fewer calories than a turkey pot pie from Pepperidge Farms.   * In the produce aisle, you'll get twice the vitamin C--and nine times as much vitamin A--simply by picking red bell peppers over green ones. (Who said eating healthy was difficult?)     <P>And that's why EAT THIS, NOT THAT! is going to change everything. It's time to level the playing field. We're all tired of sneaky calories adding to our waistlines, and having to starve ourselves or spend hours on the treadmill trying to burn off the damage. Now--for the first time--you're in charge. With this simple illustrated guide to thousands of foods--along with the nutrition secrets that lead to fast and permanent weight loss--you'll make the smartest choice every time!"

S'At the end of her bestselling memoir <I>Eat, Pray, Love</I>, Elizabeth Gilbert fell in love with Felipe, a Brazilian-born man of Australian citizenship who\'d been living in Indonesia when they met. Resettling in America, the couple swore eternal fidelity to each other, but also swore to never, ever, under any circumstances get legally married. (Both were survivors of previous bad divorces. Enough said.) But providence intervened one day in the form of the United States government, which-after unexpectedly detaining Felipe at an American border crossing-gave the couple a choice: they could either get married, or Felipe would never be allowed to enter the country again. Having been effectively sentenced to wed, Gilbert tackled her fears of marriage by delving into this topic completely, trying with all her might to discover through historical research, interviews, and much personal reflection what this stubbornly enduring old institution actually is. Told with Gilbert\'s trademark wit, intelligence and compassion, <I>Committed</I> attempts to "turn on all the lights" when it comes to matrimony, frankly examining questions of compatibility, infatuation, fidelity, family tradition, social expectations, divorce risks and humbling responsibilities. Gilbert\'s memoir is ultimately a clear-eyed celebration of love with all the complexity and consequence that real love, in the real world, actually entails.'

p7265
S'<B>The astonishing <I>New York Times</I> bestseller that chronicles how a brain scientist\'s own stroke led to enlightenment</B><BR><BR> On December 10, 1996, Jill Bolte Taylor, a thirty-seven- year-old Harvard-trained brain scientist experienced a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of her brain. As she observed her mind deteriorate to the point that she could not walk, talk, read, write, or recall any of her life-all within four hours-Taylor alternated between the euphoria of the intuitive and kinesthetic right brain, in which she felt a sense of complete well-being and peace, and the logical, sequential left brain, which recognized she was having a stroke and enabled her to seek help before she was completely lost. It would take her eight years to fully recover.<BR><BR> For Taylor, her stroke was a blessing and a revelation. It taught her that by "stepping to the right" of our left brains, we can uncover feelings of well-being that are often sidelined by "brain chatter." Reaching wide audiences through her talk at the Technology, Entertainment, Design (TED) conference and her appearance on Oprah\'s online <I>Soul Series</I>, Taylor provides a valuable recovery guide for those touched by brain injury and an inspiring testimony that inner peace is accessible to anyone.'

S'\xa0<br>The sun is setting on humanity. The night now belongs to voracious demons that arise as the sun sets, preying upon a dwindling population forced to cower behind ancient and half-forgotten symbols of power. These wards alone can keep the demons at bay, but legends tell of a Deliverer: a general\x97some would say prophet\x97who once bound all mankind into a single force that defeated the demons. Those times, if they ever existed, are long past. The demons are back, and the return of the Deliverer is just another myth . . . or is it?<br><br>Out of the desert rides Ahmann Jardir, who has forged the warlike desert tribes of Krasia into a demon-killing army. He has proclaimed himself Shar\x92Dama Ka, the Deliverer, and he carries ancient weapons\x97a spear and a crown\x97that give credence to his claim. Sworn to follow the path of the first Deliverer, he has come north to bring the scattered city-states of the green lands together in a war against demonkind\x97whether they like it or not.<br><br>\xa0\xa0\xa0 But the northerners claim their own Deliverer. His name was Arlen, but all know him now as the Warded Man: a dark, forbidding figure whose skin is tattooed with wards so powerful they make him a match for any demon. The Warded Man denies that he is the Deliverer, but his actions speak louder than words, for he teaches men and women to face their fears and stand fast against the creatures that have tormented them for centuries.<br>\xa0<br>Once the Shar\x92Dama Ka and the Warded Man were friends, brothers in arms. Now they are fierce adversaries. Caught between them are Renna, a young woman pushed to the edge of human endurance; Leesha, a proud and beautiful healer whose skill in warding surpasses that of the Warded Man himself; and Rojer, a traveling fiddler whose uncanny music can soothe the demons\x97or stir them into such frenzy that they attack one another.\xa0\xa0<br><br>\xa0\xa0\xa0 Yet as old allegiances are tested and fresh alliances forged, all are blissfully unaware of the appearance of a new breed of demon, more intelligent\x97and deadly\x97than any that have come before.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

(S"Winston's War"
p7280
S'A vivid and incisive portrait of Winston Churchill during wartime from acclaimed historian Max Hastings, <i>Winston\x92s War</i> captures the full range of Churchill\x92s endlessly fascinating character. At once brilliant and infuriating, self-important and courageous, Hastings\x92s Churchill comes brashly to life as never before. <br><br>Beginning in 1940, when popular demand elevated Churchill to the role of prime minister, and concluding with the end of the war, Hastings shows us Churchill at his most intrepid and essential, when, by sheer force of will, he kept Britain from collapsing in the face of what looked like certain defeat. Later, we see his significance ebb as the United States enters the war and the Soviets turn the tide on the Eastern Front. But Churchill, Hastings reminds us, knew as well as anyone that the war would be dominated by others, and he managed his relationships with the other Allied leaders strategically, so as to maintain Britain\x92s influence and limit Stalin\x92s gains. <br><br>At the same time, Churchill faced political peril at home, a situation for which he himself was largely to blame. Hastings shows how Churchill nearly squandered the miraculous escape of the British troops at Dunkirk and failed to address fundamental flaws in the British Army. His tactical inaptitude and departmental meddling won him few friends in the military, and by 1942, many were calling for him to cede operational control. Nevertheless, Churchill managed to exude a public confidence that brought the nation through the bitter war. <br><br>Hastings rejects the traditional Churchill hagiography while still managing to capture what he calls Churchill\x92s \x93appetite for the fray.\x94 Certain to be a classic, <i>Winston\x92s War</i> is a riveting profile of one of the greatest leaders of the twentieth century.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

Greg deconstructs pop culture, media, kids, disease, race, food, sex, celebrity, current events, and nearly every other aspect of life, with Truths including but not limited to: "if you\'re over 25 and still use <em>party</em> as a verb, then you\'re beyond redemption,""the media wanted bird flu to kill thousands,""attractive people don\'t write for a living,""death row inmates make the best husbands," and "the urge to punch Zach Braff in the face is completely natural."<br><br>With an irreverent voice, incredible wit, and a firm take on just about everything, this is a manual for how to think about stuff, by a guy who has thought about precisely that same stuff.

A brain that is susceptible to adverse environmental effects is equally susceptible to the positive effects of rich, balanced learning environments and caring relationships that build students' resilience, self-esteem, and character.<br> <br>Drawing from research, experience, and real school success stories, Teaching with Poverty in Mind reveals<br>* What poverty is and how it affects students in school;<br>* What drives change both at the macro level (within schools and districts) and at the micro level (inside a student's brain);<br>* Effective strategies from those who have succeeded and ways to replicate those best practices at your own school; and<br>* How to engage the resources necessary to make change happen.<br> <br>Too often, we talk about change while maintaining a culture of excuses. We can do better. Although no magic bullet can offset the grave challenges faced daily by disadvantaged children, this timely resource shines a spotlight on what matters most, providing an inspiring and practical guide for enriching the minds and lives of all your students."

Through language, children learn how to become strategic thinkers, not merely learning the literacy strategies. In addition, Johnston examines the complex learning that teachers produce in classrooms that is hard to name and thus is not recognized by tests, by policy-makers, by the general public, and often by teachers themselves, yet is vitally important.</p><p>This book will be enlightening for any teacher who wishes to be more conscious of the many ways their language helps children acquire literacy skills and view the world, their peers, and themselves in new ways. </p></DIV>"

Startling statistics shape our thinking about social issues. But all too often, these numbers are wrong. This book is a lively guide to spotting bad statistics and learning to think critically about these influential numbers. Damned Lies and Statistics is essential reading for everyone who reads or listens to the news, for students, and for anyone who relies on statistical information to understand social problems.    <P>Joel Best bases his discussion on a wide assortment of intriguing contemporary issues that have garnered much recent media attention, including abortion, cyberporn, homelessness, the Million Man March, teen suicide, the U.S. census, and much more. Using examples from the New York Times, the Washington Post, and other major newspapers and television programs, he unravels many fascinating examples of the use, misuse, and abuse of statistical information.    <P>In this book Best shows us exactly how and why bad statistics emerge, spread, and come to shape policy debates. He recommends specific ways to detect bad statistics, and shows how to think more critically about "stat wars," or disputes over social statistics among various experts. Understanding this book does not require sophisticated mathematical knowledge; Best discusses the most basic and most easily understood forms of statistics, such as percentages, averages, and rates.    <P>This accessible book provides an alternative to either naively accepting the statistics we hear or cynically assuming that all numbers are meaningless. It shows how anyone can become a more intelligent, critical, and empowered consumer of the statistics that inundate both the social sciences and our media-saturated lives.'

After thirteen years of marriage, he still can\x92t imagine a remotely happy life without her\x97yet he obsessively contemplates her demise. Soon she <i>is</i> dead, and David is both deeply distraught and the prime suspect.<br><br>The detectives investigating Alice\x92s suspicious death have plenty of personal experience with conjugal enigmas: Ward Hastroll is happily married until his wife inexplicably becomes voluntarily and militantly bedridden; and Sam Sheppard is especially sensitive to the intricacies of marital guilt and innocence, having decades before been convicted and then exonerated of the brutal murder of <i>his </i>wife.<br><br>Still, these men are in the business of figuring things out, even as Pepin\x92s role in Alice\x92s death grows ever more confounding when they link him to a highly unusual hit man called Mobius. Like the Escher drawings that inspire the computer games David designs for a living, these complex, interlocking dramas are structurally and emotionally intense, subtle, and intriguing; they brilliantly explore the warring impulses of affection and hatred, and pose a host of arresting questions. Is it possible to know anyone fully, <i>completely</i>?<i> </i>Are murder and marriage two sides of the same coin, each endlessly recycling into the other? And what, in the end, is the truth about love?<br><br>Mesmerizing, exhilarating, and profoundly moving, <i>Mr. Peanut </i>is a police procedural of the soul, a poignant investigation of the relentlessly mysterious human heart\x97and a first novel of the highest order.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7535
S'A stirring account of the most influential battle in history<br>\xa0<br>For millennia, Carthage\x92s triumph over Rome at Cannae in 216 B.C. has inspired reverence and awe. It was the battle that countless armies tried to imitate, most notably in World Wars I and II, the battle that obsessed legendary military minds. Yet no general ever matched Hannibal\x92s most unexpected, innovative, and brutal military victory\x97the costliest day of combat for any army in history. Robert L. O\x92Connell, one of the most admired names in military history, now tells the whole story of Cannae for the first time, giving us a stirring account of this apocalyptic battle of the Second Punic War, and its causes and consequences.<br><br>O\x92Connell shows how a restive Rome amassed a giant army to punish Carthage\x92s masterful commander, who had dealt them deadly blows at Trebia and Lake Trasimene, and how Hannibal outwitted enemies that outnumbered him. O\x92Connell describes Hannibal\x92s strategy of blinding his opponents with sun and dust, enveloping them in a deadly embrace and sealing their escape, before launching a massive knife fight that would kill 48,000 men in close contact. The Ghosts of Cannae then brilliantly conveys how this disastrous pivot point in Rome\x92s history ultimately led to the republic\x92s resurgence and the creation of its empire.<br><br>Piecing together decayed shreds of ancient reportage, the author paints powerful portraits of the leading players: Hannibal, resolutely sane and uncannily strategic; Varro, Rome\x92s co-consul who was so scapegoated for the loss; and Scipio Africanus, the surviving (and self-promoting) Roman military tribune who would one day pay back Hannibal at Zama in North Africa. Finally, O\x92Connell reveals how Cannae\x92s legend has inspired and haunted military leaders ever since, and the lessons it teaches for our own wars.<br><br>Superbly researched and written with wit and erudition, The Ghosts of Cannae is the definitive account of a battle whose history continues to resonate.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

(S"Chasing Goldman Sachs: How the Masters of the Universe Melted Wall Street Down . . . And Why They'll Take Us to the Brink Again"
p7590
S'<b>You know <i>what</i> happened during the financial crisis \x85 now it is time to understand <i>why </i>the financial system came so close to falling over the edge of the abyss and <i>why </i>it could happen again.<i> </i>Wall Street has been saved, but it hasn\x92t been reformed. What is the problem?<br></b><br> Suzanne McGee provides a penetrating look at the forces that transformed Wall Street from its traditional role as a capital-generating and economy-boosting engine into a behemoth operating with only its own short-term interests in mind and with reckless disregard for the broader financial system and those who relied on that system for their well being and prosperity. <br> <br>Primary among these influences was \x93Goldman Sachs envy\x94: the self-delusion on the part of Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers, Stanley O\x92Neil of Merrill Lynch, and other power brokers (egged on by their shareholders) that taking more risk would enable their companies to make even <i>more</i> money than Goldman Sachs. That hubris\x97and that narrow-minded focus on maximizing their short-term profits\x97led them to take extraordinary risks that they couldn\x92t manage and that later severely damaged, and in some cases destroyed, their businesses, wreaking havoc on the nation\x92s economy and millions of 401(k)s in the process.<br> <br>In a world that boasted more hedge funds than Taco Bell outlets, McGee demonstrates how it became ever harder for Wall Street to fulfill its function as the financial system\x92s version of a power grid, with capital, rather than electricity, flowing through it. But just as a power grid can be strained beyond its capacity, so too can a \x93financial grid\x94 collapse if its functions are distorted, as happened with Wall Street as it became increasingly self-serving and motivated solely by short-term profits. Through probing analysis, meticulous research, and dozens of interviews with the bankers, traders, research analysts, and investment managers who have been on the front lines of financial booms and busts, McGee provides a practical understanding of our financial \x93utility,\x94 and how it touches everyone directly as an investor and indirectly through the power\x97capital\x97that makes the economy work.<br> <br>Wall Street is as important to the economy and the overall functioning of our society as our electric and water utilities. But it doesn\x92t act that way. The financial system has been saved from destruction but as long as the mind-set of \x93chasing Goldman Sachs\x94 lingers, it will not have been reformed. As banking undergoes its biggest transformation since the 1929 crash and the Great Depression, McGee shows where it stands today and points to where it needs to go next, examining the future of those financial institutions supposedly \x93too big to fail.\x94<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7600
S'The epic life and times of one of the most important political figures in our history.<br>\xa0<br>He was the Great Compromiser, a canny and colorful legislator and leader whose life mirrors the story of America from its founding until the eve of the Civil War. Speaker of the House, senator, secretary of state, five-time presidential candidate, and idol to the young Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is captured in full at last in this rich and sweeping biography that vividly portrays all the drama of his times.<br><br>David S. Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler present Clay in his early years as a precocious, witty, and optimistic Virginia boy, raised on a farm, who at the age of twenty transformed himself from bumpkin to attorney\x97a shrewd and sincere defender of the ordinary man who would be his eventual political base. The authors reveal Clay\x92s tumultuous career in Washington, one that transformed the capital and the country. Nicknamed \x93the Western Star,\x94 Clay became the youngest Speaker of the House shortly before the War of 1812 and transformed that position into one of unprecedented power. Then, as a senator, he joined and sometimes fought John Calhoun and Daniel Webster to push through crucial legislation affecting everything from slavery to banking. Commonly regarded as the greatest U.S. senator in history, Clay served under ten presidents and overshadowed most of them, with the notable exception of his archrival Andrew Jackson. Clay ran unsuccessfully for president five times, and his participation in the deadlocked election of 1824 brought about the \x93Corrupt Bargain\x94 with John Quincy Adams that made Clay secretary of state\x97and haunted him for the rest of his career. As no other book, Henry Clay humanizes Clay\x92s marriage to plain, wealthy Lucretia Hart, a union rumored to be mercenary on his part but that lasted fifty-three years and produced eleven children.<br><br>Featuring an inimitable supporting cast including Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, James Polk, and Abraham Lincoln, Henry Clay is beautifully written and replete with fresh anecdotes and insights. But it is Henry Clay who often rises above them all. Horse trader and risk taker, arm twister and joke teller, Clay was the consummate politician who gave ground, made deals, and changed the lives of millions. His life is an astounding tale\x97and here superbly told.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

S'\xa0<br>In <b>The Journey of Man</b>, renowned geneticist and anthropologist Spencer Wells traced human evolution back to our earliest ancestors, creating a remarkable and readable map of our distant past. Now, in his thrilling new book, he examines our cultural inheritance in order to find the turning point that led us to the path we are on today, one he believes we must veer from in order to survive.<br><br><b>Pandora\x92s Seed</b> takes us on a powerful and provocative globe-trotting tour of human history, back to a seminal event roughly ten thousand years ago, when our species made a radical shift in its way of life: We became farmers rather than hunter-gatherers, setting in motion a momentous chain of events that could not have been foreseen at the time.<br><br>Although this decision to control our own food supply is what propelled us into the modern world, Wells demonstrates\x97using the latest genetic and anthropological data\x97that such a dramatic shift in lifestyle had a downside that we\x92re only now beginning to recognize. Growing grain crops ultimately made humans more sedentary and unhealthy and made the planet more crowded. The expanding population and the need to apportion limited resources such as water created hierarchies and inequalities. The desire to control\x97and no longer cooperate with\x97nature altered the concept of religion, making deities fewer and more influential, foreshadowing today\x92s fanaticisms. The proximity of humans and animals bred diseases that metastasized over time. Freedom of movement and choice were replaced by a pressure to work that is the forebear of the anxiety and depression millions feel today. Wells offers a hopeful prescription for altering a life to which we were always ill suited, recommending that we change our priorities and self-destructive appetites before it\x92s too late.<br><br>A riveting and accessible scientific detective story, <b>Pandora\x92s Seed</b> is an eye-opening book for anyone fascinated by the past and concerned about the future.<br>\xa0<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

He went undercover, usually unarmed, to catch art thieves, scammers, and black market traders in Paris and Philadelphia, Rio and Santa Fe, Miami and Madrid.<br>\xa0<br>In this page-turning memoir, Wittman fascinates with the stories behind his recoveries of priceless art and antiquities: The golden armor of an ancient Peruvian warrior king.

The rare Civil War battle flag carried into battle by one of the nation\x92s first African-American regiments.<br>\xa0<br>The breadth of Wittman\x92s exploits is unmatched: He traveled the world to rescue paintings by Rockwell and Rembrandt, Pissarro, Monet and Picasso, often working undercover overseas at the whim of foreign governments.

S'In <i>A Hidden Wholeness</i>, Parker Palmer reveals the same compassionate intelligence and informed heart that shaped his best-selling books <i>Let Your Life Speak</i> and <i>The Courage to Teach.</i> Here he speaks to our yearning to live undivided lives\x97lives that are congruent with our inner truth\x97in a world filled with the forces of fragmentation.    <p>    Mapping an inner journey that we take in solitude <i>and</i> in the company of others, Palmer describes a form of community that fits the limits of our active lives. Defining a \x93circle of trust\x94 as \x93a space between us that honors the soul,\x94 he shows how people in settings ranging from friendship to organizational life can support each other on the journey toward living \x93divided no more.\x94    <p>    This paperback edition includes two new and useful features. Circles of Trust is a DVD containing interviews with Parker J. Palmer and footage from retreats he facilitated for the Center for Courage & Renewal (www.CourageRenewal.org). Bringing the Book to Life, by Caryl Hurtig Casbon and Sally Z. Hare, is a reader\'s and leader\'s guide to exploring the themes in A Hidden Wholeness. The DVD illuminates and illustrates the principles and practices behind circles of trust. The guide includes questions that connect the DVD to the book, offering "a conversation with the author" as well as an engagement with the text. Together, these features give readers new ways to internalize the themes of A Hidden Wholeness and share with others this approach to sustaining identity and integrity in all the venues of our lives.    <p>    Inspired by Palmer\x92s writing and speaking\x97and challenged by the conditions of twenty-first century life\x97people across the country, from many walks of life, have been coming together in circles of trust to reclaim their integrity and help foster wholeness in their workplaces and their world.    <p>    For over a decade, the principles and practices in this book have been proven on the ground\x97by parents and educators, clergy and politicians, community organizers and corporate executives, physicians and attorneys, and many others who seek to rejoin soul and role in their private and public lives.    <p>    <i>A Hidden Wholeness</i> weaves together four themes that its author has pursued for forty years: the shape of an integral life, the meaning of community, teaching and learning for transformation, and nonviolent social change. The hundreds of thousands of people who know Parker Palmer\x92s books will be glad to find the journey continued'

To his surprise, when he found the house he was greeted by Dalia Ashkenazi Landau, a nineteen-year-old Israeli college student, whose family fled Europe for Israel following the Holocaust. On the stoop of their shared home, Dalia and Bashir began a rare friendship, forged in the aftermath of war and tested over the next thirty-five years in ways that neither could imagine on that summer day in 1967. Based on extensive research, and springing from his enormously resonant documentary that aired on NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i> in 1998, Sandy Tolan brings the Israeli-Palestinian conflict down to its most human level, suggesting that even amid the bleakest political realities there exist stories of hope and reconciliation. </div></div>"

S'\x93All men become brothers . . . <br>Be embraced, ye millions!\x94<br>\xa0<br>The Ninth Symphony, a symbol of freedom and joy, was Beethoven\x92s mightiest attempt to help humanity find its way from darkness to light, from chaos to peace. Yet the work was born in a repressive era, with terrified Bourbons, Hapsburgs, and Romanovs using every means at their disposal to squelch populist rumblings in the wake of the French Revolution and Napoleon\x92s wars. Ironically, the premiere of this hymn to universal brotherhood took place in Vienna, the capital of a nation that Metternich was turning into the first modern police state.<br><br>The Ninth\x92s unveiling, on May 7, 1824, was the most significant artistic event of the year, and the work remains one of the most precedent-shattering and influential compositions in the history of music\x97a reference point and inspiration that resonates even today. But in The Ninth, eminent music historian Harvey Sachs demonstrates that Beethoven was not alone in his discontent with the state of the world. Lord Byron died in 1824 during an attempt to free Greece from the domination of the Ottoman empire; Delacroix painted a masterpiece in support of that same cause; Pushkin, suffering at the hands of an autocratic czar, began to draft his anti-authoritarian play Boris Godunov; and Stendhal and Heine wrote works that mocked conventional ways of thinking.<br><br>The Ninth Symphony was so unorthodox that it amazed and confused listeners at its premiere\x97described by Sachs in vibrant detail\x97yet it became a standard for subsequent generations of creative artists, and its composer came to embody the Romantic cult of genius. In this unconventional, provocative new book, Beethoven\x92s masterwork becomes a prism through which we may view the politics, aesthetics, and overall climate of the era.<br><br>Part biography, part history, part memoir,<b> The Ninth</b> brilliantly explores the intricacies of Beethoven\x92s last symphony\x97how it brought forth the power of the individual while celebrating the collective spirit of humanity.<br>\xa0<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7735
S'<b>Two kids with the same name lived in the same decaying city. One went on to be a Rhodes Scholar, decorated combat veteran, White House Fellow, and business leader. The other is serving a life sentence in prison. Here is the story of two boys and the journey of a generation.<br></b>\xa0<br>In December 2000, the Baltimore Sun<i> </i>ran a small piece about Wes Moore, a local student who had just received a Rhodes Scholarship. The same paper also ran a series of articles about four young men who had allegedly killed a police officer in a spectacularly botched armed robbery. The police were still hunting for two of the suspects who had gone on the lam, a pair of brothers. One was named Wes Moore.\xa0 <br><br>Wes just couldn\x92t shake off the unsettling coincidence, or the inkling that the two shared much more than space in the same newspaper. After following the story of the robbery, the manhunt, and the trial to its conclusion, he wrote a letter to the other Wes, now a convicted murderer serving a life sentence without the possibility of parole. His letter tentatively asked the questions that had been haunting him: Who are you? How did this happen?<br><br>That letter led to a correspondence and relationship that have lasted for several years. Over dozens of letters and prison visits, Wes discovered that\xa0the other Wes had had a life not unlike his own: Both had grown up in similar neighborhoods and had had difficult childhoods, both were fatherless; they\x92d hung out on similar corners with similar crews, and both had run into trouble with the police. At each stage of their young lives they had come across similar moments of decision, yet their choices would lead them to astonishingly different destinies.<br><br>Told in alternating dramatic narratives that take readers from heart-wrenching losses to moments of surprising redemption, <i>The Other Wes Moore</i> tells the story of a generation of boys trying to find their way in a hostile world.<br>\xa0<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7770
S'In 2007,<i> Time</i> magazine named him one of the most influential novelists in the world. He has twice been short-listed for the Man Booker Prize.<i> The New York Times Book Review</i> called him simply \x93a genius.\x94 Now David Mitchell lends fresh credence to <i>The Guardian</i>\x92s claim that \x93each of his books seems entirely different from that which preceded it.\x94 <b>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</b> is a stunning departure for this brilliant, restless, and wildly ambitious author, a giant leap forward by even his own high standards. A bold and epic novel of a rarely visited point in history, it is a work as exquisitely rendered as it is irresistibly readable.<br><br>The year is 1799, the place Dejima in Nagasaki Harbor, the \x93high-walled, fan-shaped artificial island\x94 that is the Japanese Empire\x92s single port and sole window onto the world, designed to keep the West at bay; the farthest outpost of the war-ravaged Dutch East Indies Company; and a de facto prison for the dozen foreigners permitted to live and work there. To this place of devious merchants, deceitful interpreters, costly courtesans, earthquakes, and typhoons comes Jacob de Zoet, a devout and resourceful young clerk who has five years in the East to earn a fortune of sufficient size to win the hand of his wealthy fianc\xe9e back in Holland.<br><br>But Jacob\x92s original intentions are eclipsed after a chance encounter with Orito Aibagawa, the disfigured daughter of a samurai doctor and midwife to the city\x92s powerful magistrate. The borders between propriety, profit, and pleasure blur until Jacob finds his vision clouded, one rash promise made and then fatefully broken. The consequences will extend beyond Jacob\x92s worst imaginings.\xa0 As one cynical colleague asks, \x93Who ain\x92t a gambler in the glorious Orient, with his very life?\x94<br><br>A magnificent mix of luminous writing, prodigious research, and heedless imagination, <b>The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet</b> is the most impressive achievement of its eminent author.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7775
S'The deepest cave on earth was a prize that had remained unclaimed for centuries, long after every other ultimate discovery had been made: both poles by 1912, Everest in 1958, the Challenger Deep in 1961. In 1969 we even walked on the moon. And yet as late as 2000, the earth\x92s deepest cave\x97the supercave\x97remained undiscovered. This is the story of the men and women who risked everything to find it, earning their place in history beside the likes of Peary, Amundsen, Hillary, and Armstrong.<br>\xa0<br>In 2004, two great scientist-explorers are attempting to find the bottom of the world. Bold, heroic American Bill Stone is committed to the vast Cheve Cave, located in southern Mexico and deadly even by supercave standards. On the other side of the globe, legendary Ukrainian explorer Alexander Klimchouk\x97Stone\x92s polar opposite in temperament and style, but every bit his equal in scientific expertise, physical bravery, and sheer determination\x97has targeted Krubera, a freezing nightmare of a supercave in the Republic of Georgia, where underground dangers are compounded by the horrors of separatist war in this former Soviet republic.<br><br><b>Blind Descent</b> explores both the brightest and darkest aspects of the timeless human urge to discover\x97to be<i> </i>first<i>.</i> It is also a thrilling epic about a pursuit that makes even extreme mountaineering and ocean exploration pale by comparison. These supercavers spent months in multiple camps almost two vertical miles deep and many more miles from their caves\x92 exits. They had to contend with thousand-foot drops, deadly flooded tunnels, raging whitewater rivers, monstrous waterfalls, mile-long belly crawls, and much more. Perhaps even worse were the psychological horrors produced by weeks plunged into absolute, perpetual darkness, beyond all hope of rescue, including a particularly insidious derangement called The Rapture. <br><br>James M. Tabor was granted unprecedented access to logs, journals, photographs, and video footage of these expeditions, as well as many hours of personal interviews with surviving participants. Blind Descent is an unforgettable addition to the classic literature of discovery and adventure. It is also a testament to human survival and endurance\x97and to two extraordinary men whose relentless pursuit of greatness led them to heights of triumph and depths of tragedy neither could have imagined.<br><br><b>Includes a 16-pg full-color insert</b><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

The attempts to bring them to justice are no less dramatic, featuring vengeful Holocaust survivors, inept politicians, and daring plots to kidnap or assassinate the fugitives. <br>\xa0<br>In this exhaustively researched and compellingly written work of World War II history and investigative reporting, journalist and novelist Guy Walters gives a comprehensive account of one of the most shocking and important aspects of the war: how the most notorious Nazi war criminals escaped justice, how they were pursued, captured or able to remain free until their natural deaths and how the Nazis were assisted while they were on the run by "helpers" ranging from a Vatican bishop to a British camel doctor, and even members of\xa0Western intelligence services.\xa0 Based on all new interviews with Nazi hunters and former Nazis and intelligence agents, travels along the actual escape routes, and archival research in Germany, Britain, the United States, Austria, and Italy, <i>Hunting Evil </i>\xa0authoritatively debunks much of what has previously been understood about Nazis and Nazi hunters in the post war era, including myths about the alleged \x93Spider\x94 and \x93Odessa\x94 escape networks and the surprising truth about the world\'s most legendary Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal.\xa0 <br>\xa0<br>From its haunting chronicle of the monstrous mass murders the Nazis perpetrated and the murky details of their postwar existence to the challenges of hunting them down,<i> Hunting Evil\xa0</i>is a monumental work of nonfiction written with the pacing and intrigue of a thriller.<br>\xa0<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

Joseph appraised the likelihood of planet-wide catastrophe in 2012 by presenting convincing scientific evidence of looming chaos and even mass extinction.\xa0 Now, in\xa0<i>AFTERMATH:\xa0 A Guide to Preparing For And Surviving Apocalypse 2012</i> he answers the most pressing question to arise from the investigation: What can we do to mitigate the coming cataclysm?\xa0 <br>Here Joseph presents the latest findings about the threats to our life on earth \x96 including an all-out collapse of power grids and satellite systems resulting from solar flares expected to climax with unprecedented ferocity in 2012. Incipient plagues, famines, droughts and runaway global warming are also assessed for their catastrophic potential.\xa0 When it comes to formulating a response to an impending apocalypse, the field of options is narrow, but Joseph argues that there is plenty of constructive action that can be taken at the personal, local, national, and global level, individually and collectively, to prepare for, endure and emerge from disaster.\xa0 And Joseph takes readers beyond the end-of-the-world mania of the \x93Apoca-freaks,\x94\xa0 by offering visions of the post-apocalyptic future, ranging from the Enlightened Age the Maya foresaw to a re-drawn geopolitical map that could result from global upheaval.\xa0 <br>\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 Authoritative and written with Joseph\x92s trademark lighthearted skepticism and wit, <i>AFTERMATH </i>brings together investigative reportage from sources ranging from NASA and National Academy of Sciences to a shaman conclave in Siberia, to the Cave of the Apocalypse in Patmos, Greece, where the book of Revelation was written, plus historical research and scenario planning\xa0to offer pragmatic advice about how to control the damage should the world as we know it end in 2012.<br>\xa0<br><br>\xa0<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p7830
S'William Stoner is born at the end of the nineteenth century into a dirt-poor Missouri farming family. Sent to the state university to study agronomy, he instead falls in love with English literature and embraces a scholar\x92s life, so different from the hardscrabble existence he has known. And yet as the years pass, Stoner encounters a succession of disappointments: marriage into a \x93proper\x94 family estranges him from his parents; his career is stymied; his wife and daughter turn coldly away from him; a transforming experience of new love ends under threat of scandal. Driven ever deeper within himself, Stoner rediscovers the stoic silence of his forebears and confronts an essential solitude.<br><br>   John Williams\x92s luminous and deeply moving novel is a work of quiet perfection. William Stoner emerges from it not only as an archetypal American, but as an unlikely existential hero, standing, like a figure in a painting by Edward Hopper, in stark relief against an unforgiving world.'

S"In this masterful book, David McCullough tells the intensely human story of those who marched with General George Washington in the year of the Declaration of Independence -- when the whole American cause was riding on their success, without which all hope for independence would have been dashed and the noble ideals of the Declaration would have amounted to little more than words on paper. <P>Based on extensive research in both American and British archives, <I>1776</i> is a powerful drama written with extraordinary narrative vitality. It is the story of Americans in the ranks, men of every shape, size, and color, farmers, schoolteachers, shoemakers, no-accounts, and mere boys turned soldiers. And it is the story of the King's men, the British commander, William Howe, and his highly disciplined redcoats who looked on their rebel foes with contempt and fought with a valor too little known. <P>At the center of the drama, with Washington, are two young American patriots, who, at first, knew no more of war than what they had read in books -- Nathanael Greene, a Quaker who was made a general at thirty-three, and Henry Knox, a twenty-five-year-old bookseller who had the preposterous idea of hauling the guns of Fort Ticonderoga overland to Boston in the dead of winter. <P>But it is the American commander-in-chief who stands foremost -- Washington, who had never before led an army in battle. Written as a companion work to his celebrated biography of John Adams, David McCullough's <I>1776</i> is another landmark in the literature of American history."

To rescue Kierland's brother, they must track a vampire--and use their combined shape-shifting sensitivities in a battle that will take them beyond death. As the two learn to seek together, they begin to understand the history that has driven them apart. But they will have to overcome death itself, if their shared passion is to have a chance.<br><br>"

They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister\'s death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura\'s story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin<i>, </i>it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist.

For years he has fought to avenge the death of the woman he loved more than his own life, by revealing the deceit and cruelty of the Council that created the Breeds. But Sherra didn\'t die.

He meets a kindred spirit in Wireman, a man reluctant to reveal his own wounds, and then Elizabeth Eastlake, a sick old woman whose roots are tangled deep in Duma Key.

The country has undergone a remarkable transformation on a scale similar to that of the Industrial Revolution in the West. The most remarkable part of this transformation, however, has been left largely untold\x97the central role of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>As an organization alone, the Party is a phenomenon of unique scale and power. Its membership surpasses seventy-three million, and it does more than just rule a country. The Party not only has a grip on every aspect of government, from the largest, richest cities to the smallest far-flung villages in Tibet and Xinjiang, it also has a hold on all official religions, the media, and the military. The Party presides over large, wealthy state-owned businesses, and it exercises control over the selection of senior executives of all government companies, many of which are in the top tier of the Fortune 500 list. </p><p>In <i>The Party</i>, Richard McGregor delves deeply into China's inner sanctum for the first time, showing how the Communist Party controls the government, courts, media, and military, and how it keeps all corruption accusations against its members in-house. The Party's decisions have a global impact, yet the CPC remains a deeply secretive body, hostile to the law, unaccountable to anyone or anything other than its own internal tribunals. It is the world's only geopolitical rival of the United States, and is steadfastly poised to think the worst of the West.</p><p>In this provocative and illuminating account, Richard McGregor offers a captivating portrait of China's Communist Party, its grip on power and control over China, and its future.</p>"

S'<B>Lincoln Rhyme is back, on the trail of a killer whose weapon of choice cripples New York City with fear. <P></B>The weapon is invisible and omnipresent. Without it, modern society grinds to a halt. It is electricity. The killer harnesses and steers huge arc flashes with voltage so high and heat so searing that steel melts and his victims are set afire. <P>When the first explosion occurs in broad daylight, reducing a city bus to a pile of molten, shrapnel-riddled metal, officials fear terrorism. Rhyme, a world-class forensic criminologist known for his successful apprehension of the most devious criminals, is immediately tapped for the investigation. Long a quadriplegic, he assembles NYPD detective Amelia Sachs and officer Ron Pulaski as his eyes, ears and legs on crime sites, and FBI agent Fred Dellray as his undercover man on the street. As the attacks continue across the city at a sickening pace, and terrifying demand letters begin appearing, the team works desperately against time and with maddeningly little forensic evidence to try to find the killer. Or is it killers . . . ? <P>Meanwhile, Rhyme is consulting on another high-profile investigation in Mexico with a most coveted quarry in his crosshairs: the hired killer known as the Watchmaker, one of the few criminals to have eluded Rhyme\x92s net. <P>Juggling two massive investigations against a cruel ticking clock takes a toll on Rhyme\x92s health. Soon Rhyme is fighting on yet another front\x97and his determination to work despite his physical limitations threatens to drive away his closest allies when he needs them most . . .'

It is one of the fastest growing companies in history, an essential part of the social life not only of teenagers but hundreds of millions of adults worldwide. As Facebook spreads around the globe, it creates surprising effects\x97even becoming instrumental in political protests from Colombia to Iran. <P>Veteran technology reporter David Kirkpatrick had the full cooperation of Facebook\x92s key executives in researching this fascinating history of the company and its impact on our lives. Kirkpatrick tells us how Facebook was created, why it has flourished, and where it is going next. He chronicles its successes and missteps, and gives readers the most complete assessment anywhere of founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the central figure in the company\x92s remarkable ascent. This is the Facebook story that can be found nowhere else. <P>How did a nineteen-year-old Harvard student create a company that has transformed the Internet and how did he grow it to its current enormous size? Kirkpatrick shows how Zuckerberg steadfastly refused to compromise his vision, insistently focusing on growth over profits and preaching that Facebook must dominate (his word) communication on the Internet. In the process, he and a small group of key executives have created a company that has changed social life in the United States and elsewhere, a company that has become a ubiquitous presence in marketing, altering politics, business, and even our sense of our own identity. This is the Facebook Effect.'

Multi-layered, self-referential, elusive, and allusive writing  is now frequently labeled Borgesian. Umberto Eco\'s international  bestseller, <em>The Name of the Rose</em>, is, on one level, an  elaborate improvisation on Borges\' fiction "The Library," which  American readers first encountered in the original 1962 New Directions  publication of <em>Labyrinths</em>.<br />  <br />  This new edition of <em>Labyrinths</em>,  the classic representative selection of Borges\' writing edited by  Donald A. Yates and James E. Irby (in translations by themselves and  others), includes the text of the original edition (as augmented in  1964) as well as Irby\'s biographical and critical essay, a poignant  tribute by Andr\xe9 Maurois, and a chronology of the author\'s life.

S"<strong>In 1915 at the University of Vienna 60-year-old  Sigmund Freud delivered these lectures on  psychoanalysis, pointing to the interplay of  unconscious and conscious forces within  individual psyches.</strong>  In reasoned progression he  outlined core psychoanalytic concepts, such as  repression, free association and libido. Of the  various English translations of Freud's major  works to appear in his lifetime, only one was  authorized by Freud himself: The Standard  Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of  Sigmund Freud under the general editorship of  James Strachey.  Freud approved the overall  editorial plan, specific renderings of key words and phrases, and the addition of valuable notes,  from bibliographical and explanatory. Many of  the translations were done by Strachey himself;  the rest were prepared under his supervision.  The result was to place the Standard Edition in  a position of unquestioned supremacy over all  other existing versions.  Newly designed in a  uniform format, each new paperback in the  Standard Edition opens with a biographical essay on Freud's life and work \x97along with a note on  the individual volume\x97by Peter Gay, Sterling  Professor of History at Yale."

S"<DIV><DIV>Delving into a world once shrouded in complete mystery and impenetrable security, this investigative report provides a fascinating account of the annual meetings of the world\x92s most powerful people\x97the Bilderberg Group. Since its inception in 1954 at the Bilderberg Hotel in the small Dutch town of Oosterbeek, the Bilderberg Group has been comprised of European prime ministers, American presidents, and the wealthiest CEOs of the world, all coming together to discuss the economic and political future of humanity. The working press has never been allowed to attend, nor have statements ever been released on the attendees' conclusions or discussions, which have ramifications on the citizens of the world. Using methods that resemble the spy tactics of the Cold War\x97and in several instances putting his own life on the line\x97the author did what no one else has managed to achieve: he learned what was being said behind the closed doors of the opulent hotels and has made it available to the public.

(S'God Is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That Run the World--and Why Their Differences Matter'
p8223
S"<p>At the dawn of the twenty-first century, dizzying scientific and technological advancements, interconnected globalized economies, and even the so-called New Atheists have done nothing to change one thing: our world remains furiously religious. For good and for evil, religion is the single greatest influence in the world. We accept as self-evident that competing economic systems (capitalist or communist) or clashing political parties (Republican or Democratic) propose very different solutions to our planet's problems. So why do we pretend that the world's religious traditions are different paths to the same God? We blur the sharp distinctions between religions at our own peril, argues religion scholar Stephen Prothero, and it is time to replace na\xcfve hopes of interreligious unity with deeper knowledge of religious differences.</p><p>In <i>Religious Literacy</i>, Prothero demonstrated how little Americans know about their own religious traditions and why the world's religions should be taught in public schools. Now, in <i>God Is Not One</i>, Prothero provides readers with this much-needed content about each of the eight great religions. To claim that all religions are the same is to misunderstand that each attempts to solve a different human problem. For example:</p><blockquote><p>\x96Islam: the problem is pride / the solution is submission<br>\x96Christianity: the problem is sin / the solution is salvation<br>\x96Confucianism: the problem is chaos / the solution is social order<br>\x96Buddhism: the problem is suffering / the solution is awakening<br>\x96Judaism: the problem is exile / the solution is to return to God</p></blockquote><p>Prothero reveals each of these traditions on its own terms to create an indispensable guide for anyone who wants to better understand the big questions human beings have asked for millennia\x97and the disparate paths we are taking to answer them today. A bold polemical response to a generation of misguided scholarship, <i>God Is Not One</i> creates a new context for understanding religion in the twenty-first century and disproves the assumptions most of us make about the way the world's religions work.</p>"

S'<p>Richard A. Clarke warned America once before about the havoc terrorism would wreak on our national security -- and he was right. Now he warns us of another threat, silent but equally dangerous. <i>Cyber War</i> is a powerful book about technology, government, and military strategy; about criminals, spies, soldiers, and hackers. This is the first book about the war of the future -- cyber war -- and a convincing argument that we may already be in peril of losing it.</p><p><i>Cyber War</i> goes behind the "geek talk" of hackers and computer scientists to explain clearly and convincingly what cyber war is, how cyber weapons work, and how vulnerable we are as a nation and as individuals to the vast and looming web of cyber criminals. From the first cyber crisis meeting in the White House a decade ago to the boardrooms of Silicon Valley and the electrical tunnels under Manhattan, Clarke and coauthor Robert K. Knake trace the rise of the cyber age and profile the unlikely characters and places at the epicenter of the battlefield. They recount the foreign cyber spies who hacked into the office of the Secretary of Defense, the control systems for U.S. electric power grids, and the plans to protect America\'s latest fighter aircraft.</p><p>Economically and militarily, Clarke and Knake argue, what we\'ve already lost in the new millennium\'s cyber battles is tantamount to the Soviet and Chinese theft of our nuclear bomb secrets in the 1940s and 1950s. The possibilities of what we stand to lose in an all-out cyber war -- our individual and national security among them -- are just as chilling. Powerful and convincing, <i>Cyber War</i> begins the critical debate about the next great threat to national security.</p>'

In <i>The Invisible Gorilla,</i> Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons, creators of one of psychology\x92s most famous experiments, use remarkable stories and counterintuitive scientific findings to demonstrate an important truth: <i>Our minds don\x92t work the way we think they do.</i> We think we see ourselves and the world as they really are, but we\x92re actually missing a whole lot.<br>\xa0<br>Chabris and Simons combine the work of other researchers with their own findings on attention, perception, memory, and reasoning to reveal how faulty intuitions often get us into trouble. In the process, they explain:<br>\xa0<br>\x95 Why a company would spend billions to launch a product that its own analysts know will fail<br>\x95 How a police officer could run right past a brutal assault without seeing it<br>\x95 Why award-winning movies are full of editing mistakes<br>\x95 What criminals have in common with chess masters<br>\x95 Why measles and other childhood diseases are making a comeback<br>\x95 Why money managers could learn a lot from weather forecasters<br>\xa0<br>Again and again, we think we experience and understand the world as it is, but our thoughts are beset by everyday illusions. We write traffic laws and build criminal cases on the assumption that people will notice when something unusual happens right in front of them. We\x92re sure we know where we were on 9/11, falsely believing that vivid memories are seared into our minds with perfect fidelity. And as a society, we spend billions on devices to train our brains because we\x92re continually tempted by the lure of quick fixes and effortless self-improvement. <br>\xa0<br><i>The Invisible Gorilla</i> reveals the myriad ways that our intuitions can deceive us, but it\x92s much more than a catalog of human failings. Chabris and Simons explain why we succumb to these everyday illusions and what we can do to inoculate ourselves against their effects.

S"The ordeal of the whaleship Essex was an event as mythic  in the nineteenth century as the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> was in  the twentieth. In 1819, the <i>Essex</i> left Nantucket for the South  Pacific with twenty crew members aboard. In the middle of the South  Pacific the ship was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. The crew  drifted for more than ninety days in three tiny whaleboats, succumbing  to weather, hunger, disease, and ultimately turning to drastic  measures in the fight for survival. Nathaniel Philbrick uses  little-known documents-including a long-lost account written by the  ship's cabin boy-and penetrating details about whaling and the  Nantucket community to reveal the chilling events surrounding this  epic maritime disaster. An intense and mesmerizing read, <i>In the  Heart of the Sea</i> is a monumental work of history forever placing  the Essex tragedy in the American historical canon."

p8337
S"<p>  The great Russian psychologist L. S. Vygotsky has long been recognized as a pioneer in developmental psychology. But somewhat ironically, his theory of development has never been well understood in the West. <i>Mind in Society</i> should correct much of this misunderstanding. Carefully edited by a group of outstanding Vygotsky scholars, the book presents a unique selection of Vygotsky's important essays, most of which have previously been unavailable in English.  </p><p>  The Vygotsky who emerges from these pages can no longer be glibly included among the neobehaviorists. In these essays he outlines a dialectical-materialist theory of cognitive development that anticipates much recent work in American social science. The mind, Vygotsky argues, cannot be understood in isolation from the surrounding society. Man is the only animal who uses tools to alter his own inner world as well as the world around him. From the handkerchief knotted as a simple mnemonic device to the complexities of symbolic language, society provides the individual with technology that can be used to shape the private processes of mind. In <i>Mind in Society</i> Vygotsky applies this theoretical framework to the development of perception, attention, memory, language, and play, and he examines its implications for education. The result is a remarkably interesting book that is bound to renew Vygotsky's relevance to modem psychological thought.  </p>"

Many of us placed our faith in these things, believing they held the key to happiness, but with a sneaking suspicion they might not deliver. The recent economic meltdown has cast a harsh new light on these pursuits. In a matter of months, fortunes, marriages, careers, and a secure retirement have disappeared for millions of people. No wonder so many of us feel lost, alone, disenchanted, and resentful. But the truth is that we made lesser gods of these good things -gods that can\'t give us what we really need. There is only one God who can wholly satisfy our cravings- and now is the perfect time to meet him again, or for the first time.<BR><BR> The Bible tells us that the human heart is an "idol- factory," taking good things and making them into idols that drive us.

But before he can go on vacation, he has police work to do. A folder with court records has landed on his desk, brought by an old friend. It appears that certain cases at the local court\x97hardly known as a model of efficiency\x97are being delayed to the benefit of one of the parties. A creative new trick for corrupting the system, perhaps, but what can Brunetti do about it?      At the same time, Brunetti is doing a favor for his colleague, Inspector Lorenzo Vianello. The inspector\x92s aunt has taken a strong interest in astrology and has been regularly withdrawing large amounts of cash from the bank. But she won\x92t listen to her family, and Vianello doesn\x92t know what to do. Brunetti agrees to help. He assigns the Questura\x92s new recruits, who need training in following a suspect through Venice\x92s complicated streets, to see where the money is going.      And just when it looks like Brunetti will be able to get away for his well-earned rest, a shocking, violent crime forces him to shake off the heat and get down to work. A Question of Belief is a stellar addition to Leon\x92s celebrated series: atmospheric, packed with excellent characters, and building to an explosive, indelible ending.'

His fast life and mysterious death remain controversial more than twenty years later. <P> <I>The Lords and the New Creatures,</I> Morrison\'s first published volume of poetry, is an uninhibited exploration of society\'s dark side -- drugs, sex, fame, and death -- captured in sensual, seething images.

S'\x93I finally understand what the poets have written. In spring, moved to passion; in autumn only regret.\x94<br><br>For young Peony, betrothed to a suitor she has never met, these lyrics from The Peony Pavilion mirror her own longings. In the garden of the Chen Family Villa, amid the scent of ginger, green tea, and jasmine, a small theatrical troupe is performing scenes from this epic opera, a live spectacle few females have ever seen. Like the heroine in the drama, Peony is the cloistered daughter of a wealthy family, trapped like a good-luck cricket in a bamboo-and-lacquer cage. Though raised to be obedient, Peony has dreams of her own.<br><br>Peony\x92s mother is against her daughter\x92s attending the production: \x93Unmarried girls should not be seen in public.\x94 But Peony\x92s father assures his wife that proprieties will be maintained, and that the women will watch the opera from behind a screen. Yet through its cracks, Peony catches sight of an elegant, handsome man with hair as black as a cave\x96and is immediately overcome with emotion.<br><br>So begins Peony\x92s unforgettable journey of love and destiny, desire and sorrow\x96as Lisa See\x92s haunting new novel, based on actual historical events, takes readers back to seventeenth-century China, after the Manchus seize power and the Ming dynasty is crushed. <br><br>Steeped in traditions and ritual, this story brings to life another time and place\x96even the intricate realm of the afterworld, with its protocols, pathways, and stages of existence, a vividly imagined place where one\x92s soul is divided into three, ancestors offer guidance, misdeeds are punished, and hungry ghosts wander the earth. Immersed in the richness and magic of the Chinese vision of the afterlife, transcending even death, <i>Peony in Love</i> explores, beautifully, the many manifestations of love. Ultimately, Lisa See\x92s new novel addresses universal themes: the bonds of friendship, the power of words, and the age-old desire of women to be heard.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>'

p8454
S'<p>In the twenty years since its publication, <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> has helped over a million seekers discover a richer spiritual life infused with joy, peace, and a deeper understanding of God. For this special twentieth anniversary edition, Richard J. Foster has added an introduction, in which he shares the story of how this beloved and enduring spiritual guidebook came to be.<p>Hailed by many as the best modern book on Christian spirituality, <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> explores the "classic Disciplines," or central spiritual practices, of the Christian faith. Along the way, Foster shows that it is only by and through these practices that the true path to spiritual growth can be found.<p>Dividing the Disciplines into three movements of the Spirit, Foster shows how each of these areas contribute to a balanced spiritual life. The inward Disciplines of meditation, prayer, fasting, and study, offer avenues of personal examination and change. The outward Disciplines of simplicity, solitude, submission, and service, help prepare us to make the world a better place.The corporate Disciplines of confession, worship, guidance, and celebration, bring us nearer to one another and to God.<p>Foster provides a wealth of examples demonstrating how these Disciplines can become part of our daily activities-and how they can help us shed our superficial habits and "bring the abundance of God into our lives." He offers crucial new insights on simplicity, demonstrating how the biblical view of simplicity, properly understood and applied, brings joy and balance to our inward and outward lives and "sets us free to enjoy the provision of God as a gift that can be shared with others." The discussion of celebration, often the most neglected of the Disciplines, shows its critical importance, for it stands at the heart of the way to Christ. <i>Celebration of Discipline</i> will help motivate Christians everywhere to embark on a journey of prayer and spiritual growth.'

Buck went on to become the first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for Literature. Long before anyone else, she foresaw China\x92s future as a superpower, and she recognized the crucial importance for both countries of China\x92s building a relationship with the United States. As a teenager she had witnessed the first stirrings of Chinese revolution, and as a young woman she narrowly escaped being killed in the deadly struggle between Chinese Nationalists and the newly formed Communist Party. <P> <P> <P>Pearl grew up in an imperial China unchanged for thousands of years. She was the child of American missionaries, but she spoke Chinese before she learned English, and her friends were the children of Chinese farmers. She took it for granted that she was Chinese herself until she was eight years old, when the terrorist uprising known as the Boxer Rebellion forced her family to flee for their lives. It was the first of many desperate flights. Flood, famine, drought, bandits, and war formed the background of Pearl\x92s life in China. "Asia was the real, the actual world," she said, "and my own country became the dreamworld." <P> <P> <P>Pearl wrote about the realities of the only world she knew in <I>The Good Earth. </i>It was one of the last things she did before being finally forced out of China to settle for the first time in the United States. She was unknown and penniless with a failed marriage behind her, a disabled child to support, no prospects, and no way of telling that <I>The Good Earth </i>would sell tens of millions of copies. It transfixed a whole generation of readers just as Jung Chang\x92s <I>Wild Swans </i>would do more than half a century later. No Westerner had ever written anything like this before, and no Chinese had either. <P> <P> <P> <P>Buck was the forerunner of a wave of Chinese Americans from Maxine Hong Kingston to Amy Tan. Until their books began coming out in the last few decades, her novels were unique in that they spoke for ordinary Asian people\x97 "translating my parents to me," said Hong Kingston, "and giving me our ancestry and our habitation." As a phenomenally successful writer and civil-rights campaigner, Buck did more than anyone else in her lifetime to change Western perceptions of China. In a world with its eyes trained on China today, she has much to tell us about what lies behind its astonishing reawakening.'

This sepia-toned memoir takes you on Steagald\'s daily pastoral rounds from pre-dawn rising to a rest found only in the assurance of Christ\'s mercy. In between is a richly- textured account of little moments seized for consecration - prayers in the shower, coffee at Hardee\'s, choir practice and the surprises that test our perception of what in our lives is God\'s business. "It is our faith, and by faith I really mean trust, that no person, no situation, no circumstance exists without Him, or devoid of Him, or apart from His grace." So it is that Steagald dismantles the strict compartments of our ordinary" lives and invites us to offer our entire beings to Christ.'

p8644
S"What does it mean to be a man? Moreover, how does a father instill these qualities in his son? Using as an example the process by which a boy moved through the medieval stages of knighthood, Robert Lewis identifies parallel stages for today's fathers to create ceremonies to commemorate significant milestones in a young man's journey toward becoming a modern-day knight. Beginning with a biblical perspective of manhood, Robert Lewis shares a unique approach to shaping a boy into a man by equipping him with three essential elements: a vision, a code of conduct, and a cause (Christianity) in which to invest his life. Complete with ceremony ideas to celebrate accomplishments and ingrain them in his mind, this softcover is as insightful as it is practical in raising a boy to be a chivalrous, godly man."

p8659
S'<p>For seven years, Alison Arngrim played a wretched, scheming, selfish, lying, manipulative brat on one of TV history\'s most beloved series. Though millions of <i>Little House on the Prairie</i> viewers hated Nellie Oleson and her evil antics, Arngrim grew to love her character\x97and the freedom and confidence Nellie inspired in her.</p><p>In <i>Confessions of a Prairie Bitch</i>, Arngrim describes growing up in Hollywood with her eccentric parents: Thor Arngrim, a talent manager to Liberace and others, whose appetite for publicity was insatiable, and legendary voice actress Norma MacMillan, who played both Gumby and Casper the Friendly Ghost. She recalls her most cherished and often wickedly funny moments behind the scenes of <i>Little House</i>: Michael Landon\'s "unsaintly" habit of not wearing underwear; how she and Melissa Gilbert (who played her TV nemesis, Laura Ingalls) became best friends and accidentally got drunk on rum cakes at 7-Eleven; and the only time she and Katherine MacGregor (who played Nellie\'s mom) appeared in public in costume, provoking a posse of elementary schoolgirls to attack them.</p><p>Arngrim relays all this and more with biting wit, but she also bravely recounts her life\'s challenges: her struggle to survive a history of traumatic abuse, depression, and paralyzing shyness; the "secret" her father kept from her for twenty years; and the devastating loss of her "<i>Little House</i> husband" and best friend, Steve Tracy, to AIDS, which inspired her second career in social and political activism. Arngrim describes how Nellie Oleson taught her to be bold, daring, and determined, and how she is eternally grateful to have had the biggest little bitch on the prairie to show her the way.</p>'

p8679
S'On April 20, 1999, two boys left an indelible stamp on the American psyche. Their goal was simple: to blow up their school, Oklahoma-City style, and to leave "a lasting impression on the world." Their bombs failed, but the ensuing shooting defined a new era of school violence-irrevocably branding every subsequent shooting "another Columbine."<br><br>When we think of Columbine, we think of the Trench Coat Mafia; we think of Cassie Bernall, the girl we thought professed her faith before she was shot; and we think of the boy pulling himself out of a school window -- the whole world was watching him. Now, in a riveting piece of journalism nearly ten years in the making, comes the story none of us knew. In this revelatory book, Dave Cullen has delivered a profile of teenage killers that goes to the heart of psychopathology. He lays bare the callous brutality of mastermind Eric Harris, and the quavering, suicidal Dylan Klebold, who went to prom three days earlier and obsessed about love in his journal. <br><br>The result is an astonishing account of two good students with lots of friends, who came to stockpile a basement cache of weapons, to record their raging hatred, and to manipulate every adult who got in their way. They left signs everywhere, described by Cullen with a keen investigative eye and psychological acumen. Drawing on hundreds of interviews, thousands of pages of police files, FBI psychologists, and the boy\'s tapes and diaries, he gives the first complete account of the Columbine tragedy.<br><br>In the tradition of HELTER SKELTER and IN COLD BLOOD, COLUMBINE is destined to be a classic. A close-up portrait of hatred, a community rendered helpless, and the police blunders and cover-ups, it is a compelling and utterly human portrait of two killers-an unforgettable cautionary tale for our times.'

A junior doctor at a local hospital, she is something of a scandal in the conservative and highly patriarchal society of 1950s Dublin.

Frantic, Phoebe seeks out Quirke, her brilliant but erratic father, and asks him for help. Sober again after intensive treatment for alcoholism, Quirke enlists his old sparring partner, Detective Inspector Hackett, in the search for the missing young woman. In their separate ways the two men follow April's trail through some of the darker byways of the city to uncover crucial information on her whereabouts. And as Quirke becomes deeply involved in April's murky story, he encounters complicated and ugly truths about family savagery, Catholic ruthlessness, and race hatred.</P><P>Both an absorbing crime novel and a brilliant portrait of the difficult and relentless love between a father and his daughter, this is Benjamin Black at his sparkling best.</P>"

S'<P> <B>One of the most important theologians of the twentieth century illuminates the relationship between ourselves and the teachings of Jesus</B> <P> What can the call to discipleship, the adherence to the word of Jesus, mean today to the businessman, the soldier, the laborer, or the aristocrat? What did Jesus mean to say to us? What is his will for us today? Drawing on the Sermon on the Mount, Dietrich Bonhoeffer answers these timeless questions by providing a seminal reading of the dichotomy between "cheap grace" and "costly grace." "Cheap grace," Bonhoeffer wrote, "is the grace we bestow on ourselves...grace without discipleship....Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the girl which must be asked for, the door at which a man must know....It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life." <P> <I>The Cost of Discipleship</I> is a compelling statement of the demands of sacrifice and ethical consistency from a man whose life and thought were exemplary articulations of a new type of leadership inspired by the Gospel, and imbued with the spirit of Christian humanism and a creative sense of civic duty.'

It is a part of us and yet we spend most of our life running from it. But far from being scary, our dark side holds the promise of a better, more fulfilling life. Our shadow makes itself known every day. It is the reason we get furious over a friend showing up ten minutes late, yell at our parents or kids when they have done nothing wrong, and sabotage our own success at the worst possible time. Until we are able to embrace our dualistic nature, we will continue to hurt ourselves and those closest to us and fall short of our potential.</p><p>Combining the wisdom of three experts, <i>The Shadow Effect</i> is a practical and profound guide to discovering the gifts of our shadow.

p8758
S'Feel caught between the traditional church and the emerging church? Discover a third way: deep church.    <P>C. S. Lewis used the phrase "deep church" to describe the body of believers committed to mere Christianity. Unfortunately church in our postmodern era has been marked by a certain shallowness. Emerging authors, fed up with contemporary pragmatism, have offered alternative visions for twenty-first-century Christianity. Traditionalist churches have reacted negatively, at times defensively.    <P>Jim Belcher knows what it\'s like to be part of both of these worlds. In the 1990s he was among the pioneers of what was then called Gen X ministry, hanging out with creative innovators like Rob Bell, Mark Oestreicher and Mark Driscoll. But he also has maintained ties to traditionalist circles, planting a church in the Presbyterian Church of America.    <P>In Deep Church, Belcher brings the best insights of all sides to forge a third way between emerging and traditional. In a fair and evenhanded way, Belcher explores the proposals of such emerging church leaders as Tony Jones, Brian McLaren and Doug Pagitt. He offers measured appreciation and affirmation as well as balanced critique. Moving beyond reaction, Belcher provides constructive models from his own church planting experience and paints a picture of what this alternate, deep church looks like--a missional church committed to both tradition and culture, valuing innovation in worship, arts and community but also creeds and confessions.    <P>If you\'ve felt stuck between two extremes, you can find a home here. Plumb the depths of Christianity in a way that neither rejects our postmodern context nor capitulates to it. Instead of veering to the left or the right, go between the extremes--and go deep.'

S'Do you find yourself picking through circumstances like children plucking daisy petals attempting to figure out whether or not God loves you?  If you find yourself least certain of his love in those critical moments when you most need to trust him, there is hope for you.    Where?  At the one event in human history that forever secured your place in the Father s hear--the cross where Jesus allowed sin and shame to be consumed in his own body so that you could freely embrace a relationship with his Father.  There you will discover that what he always wanted was not the fearful subservience of slaves, but the loving affection of sons and daughters.

The order in which students choose to use the books, and the ways in which they study them, depend on their particular needs and preferences.    <P>The curriculum the Course proposes is carefully conceived and is explained, step by step, at both the theoretical and practical levels. It emphasizes application rather than theory, and experience rather than theology. Although Christian in statement, the Course deals with universal spiritual themes. It emphasizes that it is but one version of the universal curriculum. There are many others, this one differing from them only in form. They all lead to God in the end.    <P>The Text is largely theoretical, and sets forth the concepts on which the Course's thought system is based. Its ideas contain the foundation for the Workbook's lessons. Without the practical application the Workbook provides, the Text would remain largely a series of abstractions which would hardly suffice to bring about the thought reversal at which the Course aims.    <P>The Workbook includes 365 lessons, one for each day of the year. It is not necessary, however, to do the lessons at that tempo, and one might want to remain with a particularly appealing lesson for more than one day. The practical nature of the Workbook is underscored by the introduction to its lessons, which emphasizes experience through application rather than a prior commitment to a spiritual goal:    <P>Some of the ideas the workbook presents you will find hard to believe, and others may seem to be quite startling. This does not matter. You are merely asked to apply the ideas as you are directed to do. You are not asked to judge them at all. You are asked only to use them. It is their use that will give them meaning to you, and will show you that they are true.     <P>Finally, the Manual for Teachers, which is written in question and answer form, provides answers to some of the more likely questions a student might ask. It also includes a clarification of a number of the terms the Course uses, explaining them within the theoretical framework of the Text.    <P>The Course makes no claim to finality, nor are the Workbook lessons intended to bring the student's learning to completion. At the end, the reader is left in the hands of his or her own Internal Teacher, Who will direct all subsequent learning as He sees fit."

p8798
S'Men are rediscovering the importance of the spiritual life. And Father Larry Richards is helping them do it. While some writers apply a one-size-fits-all approach to the Christian life, Father Richards draws on his many years of ministry and his own experience as a man to inspire other men as men. <p>In <i>Be a Man!</i>, he recounts his struggles to learn true manhood, as well as the inspiring stories of others he has served in his decades as a priest. He tells men how to focus on the right goal, how to live as a beloved son of God, of the need to acknowledge one\'s faults and to live according to the Holy Spirit, to be a man of true love and of wisdom, to appreciate properly the differences between men and women, to pursue holiness, and to make a difference in the world. Not preachy but direct, Father Richards challenges men to be strong, without putting on a mask of false strength or machismo. He calls men to admit their weaknesses and limitations, while urging them to find strength in faith and genuine love to overcome their sins and faults. <p>Although a celibate priest, he minces no words when it comes to the place of sexuality for the unmarried man as well as for the married man. He shows that true manliness is not opposed to love but thrives on it. Father Richards stresses that a relationship with Christ reveals the meaning of a man\'s life and his identity as a man. He inspires men to become the true heroes they long to be men of authentic courage, compassion and integrity. This is a highly readable book for men by a man who knows how to talk to men about the things that matter most. <p><b>Fr. Larry Richards</b>, a popular speaker at men s conferences around the country, is the pastor of an inner city parish in Erie, PA. He hosts his own daily national radio show on Relevant Radio, and is the founder of "The Reason for Our Hope Foundation". <p>"Father Larry talks straight to men in his own manly style. He pulls no spiritual punches-I don\'t think he knows how to! He pokes, pushes, sometimes verbally slaps men into being God\'s men, all with an obvious love for them and faith in their ability to persevere to heaven."<br><br><b>-Dr. Ray Guarendi</b>, Psychologist, National Syndicated Radio Host, and Author<p> "<i>Be a Man!</i> is a must-read for all men who are serious about strengthening their relationship with God. This exceptional book speaks clearly and directly, challenging men to live their faith with courage and conviction. <i>Be a Man!</i> is a spiritual wake-up call that offers a refreshingly honest presentation of what it means to be a man of God. With a unique blend of humor, passion, and frankness that has become his trademark style, Fr. Larry Richards explores how a Christ-centered male spirituality fosters growth in holiness, and inspires men to become loving servants of their wives, families, and the Church." <br><b>-Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers</b>, Author, EWTN TV Series Host'

Filled with never-before-told stories and otherworldly encounters, <i>Psychic</i> is a riveting account of how Sylvia Shoemaker, a traditional girl from Missouri, became world-famous psychic Sylvia Browne.</p><p>Nothing is off-limits. Sylvia tells the little-known truths behind her three failed marriages\x97including physical abuse, bankruptcy, and legal troubles\x97and the financial and emotional damage they wreaked. She revisits her personal demons and describes her physical challenges, including her relatively recent discovery that she'd suddenly gone blind in one eye.

Unlike any other book Sylvia has written, <i>Psychic</i> reaches deep beneath the surface of her life, including professional and personal experiences that she is sharing publicly for the first time. With candor, warmth, and a great deal of humor, Sylvia Browne has written the singularly captivating tale of a life lived in two worlds, filled equally with harsh earthly realities and mesmerizing spiritual insights.</p>"

While filming on the Chinese\x96North Korean border, they were chased down by North Korean soldiers who violently apprehended them. Laura and Euna were charged with trespassing and "hostile acts," and imprisoned by Kim Jong Il\'s notoriously secretive Communist state.

They were the first Americans ever to be sentenced to twelve years of hard labor in a prison camp in North Korea.</p><p>When news of the arrest reached Laura\'s sister, journalist Lisa Ling, she immediately began a campaign to get her sister released, one that led her from the State Department to the higher echelons of the media world and eventually to the White House. </p><p><i>Somewhere Inside</i> reveals for the first time Laura\'s gripping account of what really happened on the river, her treatment at the hands of North Korean guards, and the deprivations and rounds of harrowing interrogations she endured.

p8898
S"<blockquote><p>The acclaimed <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Dragon Keeper</i> returns with a second enthralling tale of dragons and humans, adventure and discovery, love and freedom</p></blockquote><p>Centuries had passed since dragons last roamed the war-torn world of the Rain Wild River. But as peace once again settled upon the land, a lost generation of sea serpents\x97ancient, half-starved, and weary\x97returned to cocoon, certain that they would be reborn as the beautiful and powerful dragons of legend. But their arduous journey exacted a heavy toll, and the proud serpents emerged as sickly, half-formed beasts, unable to fly or hunt . . . or thrive. For years now they have been trapped on a swampy riverbank between forest and river, hungry and barely alive, reliant on humans to provide for them.</p><p>With their survival at stake, fifteen dragons\x97among them the wise golden Mercor, the haughty and dazzling silver-blue queen Sintara, and the delicate copper beauty Relpda\x97have set off on a dangerous trek into the unknown, up the Rain Wild River, in hopes of rediscovering the ancient Elderling city of Kelsingra, the lost haven for dragons and Elderlings alike. The dragons are accompanied by a disparate group of human keepers, rejects from Rain Wild society. They, too, yearn to find Kelsingra and create a home of their own, one in which they may make their own rules and decide their own fate. But is Kelsingra real or merely a fragment of a glorified past buried deep in the dragons' shared memories? No map exists to guide them, and the noble creatures find their ancient recollections of little use in a land changed by generations of flooding and seismic chaos. </p><p>As the dragons, the humans\x97including the strong and defiant Rain Wild girl Thymara; the wealthy dragon scholar and Trader's wife, Alise; and her companion, the urbane Sedric\x97and their magical supply barge, captained by the gruff Leftrin, forge their way ever deeper into uncharted wilderness, human and beast alike discover they are changing in mysterious and dangerous ways. While the bonds between them solidify, starvation, flashfloods, and predators will imperil them all. But dragons and humans soon learn that the most savage threats come from within their own company . . . and not all of them may survive. </p><p>Returning to the territory of her beloved Liveship Traders and Tawny Man trilogies, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Robin Hobb creates a lush and ultimately triumphant tale set in an imaginative world of magic and wonder as compelling and emotionally resonant as our own.</p>"

S"Understanding the role of fascia in healthy movement and postural distortion is of vital importance to bodyworkers and movement therapists. Anatomy Trains: Myofascial Meridians for Manual and Movement Therapists presents a unique 'whole systems' view of myofascial/locomotor anatomy in which the bodywide connections among the muscles within the fascial net are described in detail for the first time.

p8972
S'<P>For years Christians have been asking, "If you died tonight, do you know where you would go?" It turns out that many believers have been giving the wrong answer. It is not heaven. </P> <P>Award-winning author N. T. Wright outlines the present confusion about a Christian\'s future hope and shows how it is deeply intertwined with how we live today. Wright, who is one of today\'s premier Bible scholars, asserts that Christianity\'s most distinctive idea is bodily resurrection. He provides a magisterial defense for a literal resurrection of Jesus and shows how this became the cornerstone for the Christian community\'s hope in the bodily resurrection of all people at the end of the age. Wright then explores our expectation of "new heavens and a new earth," revealing what happens to the dead until then and what will happen with the "second coming" of Jesus. For many, including many Christians, all this will come as a great surprise. </P> <P>Wright convincingly argues that what we believe about life after death directly affects what we believe about life before death. For if God intends to renew the whole creation\x97and if this has already begun in Jesus\'s resurrection\x97the church cannot stop at "saving souls" but must anticipate the eventual renewal by working for God\'s kingdom in the wider world, bringing healing and hope in the present life. </P> <P>Lively and accessible, this book will surprise and excite all who are interested in the meaning of life, not only after death but before it. </P>'

His statement not only marked the end of the band's remarkable career, but also seemed to signal the demise of an era of unprecedented optimism in social history. Though the Beatles' breakup was widely viewed as a cultural tragedy, one of the most fascinating phases of their story was just about to begin.</p><p>Now, for the first time, <i>You Never Give Me Your Money</i> tells the behind-the-scenes story of the personal rivalries and legal feuds that have dominated the Beatles' lives since 1969. Journalist Peter Doggett charts the Shakespearean battles between Lennon and McCartney, the conflict in George Harrison's life between spirituality and fame, and the struggle with alcoholism that threatened to take Richard Starkey's life. In vivid detail, Doggett also describes the wild mismanagement of the Beatles' fortune staked largely in Apple Corps. </p><p><i>You Never Give Me Your Money</i> is a compelling human drama and an equally rich and absorbing story of the Beatles' creative and financial empire, set up to safeguard their interests but destined to control their lives.

Focus.  <P>Each idea is examined here, simply showing why it is time to simplify.'

p8997
S'"It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains." So begins <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em>, an expanded edition of the beloved Jane Austen novel featuring all-new scenes of bone-crunching zombie mayhem. As our story opens, a mysterious plague has fallen upon the quiet English village of Meryton and the dead are returning to life! Feisty heroine Elizabeth Bennet is determined to wipe out the zombie menace, but she\'s soon distracted by the arrival of the haughty and arrogant Mr. Darcy. What ensues is a delightful comedy of manners with plenty of civilized sparring between the two young lovers and even more violent sparring on the blood-soaked battlefield as Elizabeth wages war against hordes of flesh-eating undead. Can she vanquish the spawn of Satan? And overcome the social prejudices of the class-conscious landed gentry? Complete with romance, heartbreak, swordfights, cannibalism, and thousands of rotting corpses, <em>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</em> transforms a masterpiece of world literature into something you\'d actually want to read.'

In 1945, the three books - Lark Rise (1939), Over to Candleford (1941), and Candleford Green (1943), were published together in one elegant volume, and this new omnibus Nonpareil edition, complete with charming wood engravings, should be a cause for real rejoicing. <br><br>This is the story of three closely-related Oxfordshire communities -- a hamlet, a village, and a town -- and the memorable cast of characters who people them. Based on Thompson's own experiences as a child and young woman, it is keenly observed and beautifully narrated, quiet and evocative. <br><br>The books have inspired two plays that ran in London, and the trilogy has been adapted into a multi-part, long-running television drama series by the BBC. The first series of ten episodes is scheduled to be syndicated on various PBS stations throughout the Unites States."

When the right moment comes, Bormann leaves the doomed Third Reich forever, taking with him 50 million in stolen Nazi gold. His surprising destination is Pea Island, a lonely strip of sand north of Cape Hatteras North Carolina. Will his plan succeed? Populated with exquisite, compelling, and memorable characters who will stay with readers long after the final page is turned, Hitler's Judas introduces a remarkable supporting cast, including Horst Von Hellenbach, Germany's celebrated U-Boat captain who detests war and the Nazi regime and is in terminal conflict with his sworn military duty; Elisabeth Kroll, an impressionable woman unable to choose between Horst or his twin brother Harold, a handsome, respected surgeon and fanatic Nazi; Edda Winter, Bormann's mistress and talented actress who hopes Bormann will be her ticket to Hollywood; Klaus Berger, Germany's most famous thespian, whose very life depends on how well he plays his most difficult role; and Sunday Everette, a stunning young black woman who stands in the way of Bormann and his goal.

Stephen Mitchell now brings to the Bhagavad Gita his gift for breathing new life into sacred texts.<br> <br>The Bhagavad Gita is universally acknowledged as one of the world\'s literary and spiritual masterpieces. It is the core text of the Hindu tradition and has been treasured by American writers from Emerson and Thoreau to T. S.

There have been more than two hundred English translations of the Gita, including many competent literal versions, but not one of them is a superlative literary text in its own right.<br><br>Now all that has changed.

S'<DIV><DIV><P>From the <I>New York Times</I> bestselling author of <I>On Mystic Lake</I> comes a powerful novel\xa0of love, loss, and the magic of friendship. . . .</P><P>In the turbulent summer of 1974, Kate Mularkey has accepted her place at the bottom of the eighth-grade social food chain. Then, to her amazement, the \x93coolest girl in the world\x94 moves in across the street and wants to be her friend. Tully Hart seems to have it all---beauty, brains, ambition. On the surface they are as opposite as two people can be: Kate, doomed to be forever uncool, with a loving family who mortifies her at every turn. Tully, steeped in glamour and mystery, but with a secret that is destroying her. They make a pact to be best friends forever; by summer\x92s end they\x92ve become <I>TullyandKate.</I> Inseparable.</P><P>So begins Kristin Hannah\x92s magnificent new novel. Spanning more than three decades and playing out across the ever-changing face of the Pacific Northwest, <I>Firefly Lane</I> is the poignant, powerful story of two women and the friendship that becomes the bulkhead of their lives. </P><P>From the beginning, Tully is desperate to prove her worth to the world. Abandoned by her mother at an early age, she longs to be loved unconditionally. In the glittering, big-hair era of the eighties, she looks to men to fill the void in her soul. But in the buttoned-down nineties, it is television news that captivates her. She will follow her own blind ambition to New York and around the globe, finding fame and success . . . and loneliness.\xa0 </P><P>Kate knows early on that her life will be nothing special. Throughout college, she pretends to be driven by a need for success, but all she really wants is to fall in love and have children and live an ordinary life. In her own quiet way, Kate is as driven as Tully. What she doesn\x92t know is how being a wife and mother will change her . . . how she\x92ll lose sight of who she once was, and what she once wanted. And how much she\x92ll envy her famous best friend. . . .</P><P>For thirty years, Tully and Kate buoy each other through life, weathering the storms of friendship---jealousy, anger, hurt, resentment. They think they\x92ve survived it all until a single act of betrayal tears them apart . . . and puts their courage and friendship to the ultimate test.</P><P><I>Firefly Lane</I> is for anyone who ever drank Boone\x92s Farm apple wine while listening to Abba or Fleetwood Mac. More than a coming-of-age novel, it\x92s the story of a generation of women who were both blessed and cursed by choices. It\x92s about promises and secrets and betrayals. And ultimately, about the one person who really, truly knows you---and knows what has the power to hurt you . . . and heal you. <I>Firefly Lane </I>is a story you\x92ll never forget . . . one you\x92ll want to pass on to your best friend.</P></DIV></DIV>'

The path to spiritual transformation begins here.    <P>Turning to the Gospels, Smith invites you to put your ideas to the test to see if they match up with what Jesus himself reveals about God. Once you\'ve discovered the truth in Scripture, Smith leads you through a process of spiritual formation that includes specific activities aimed at making these new narratives real in your body and soul as well as your mind.    <P>At the end of each chapter you\'ll find an opportunity for soul training, engaging in spiritual practices that reinforce the biblical messages on your mind and heart. Because the best way to make a complete and lasting change is to go through the material in community, small group discussion questions also accompany each chapter. Those who are leading apprentice groups will also find additional help and opportunities to interact with other leaders at the Apprentice website.    <P>This deep, loving and transformative book will help you discover the narratives that Jesus lived by--to know the Lord he knew and the kingdom he proclaimed--and to practice spiritual exercises that will help you grow in the knowledge of our good and beautiful God.'

Drawn from a rich heritage left us by the early church fathers,  the Puritan writers, and Jesus Christ Himself, Spiritual Disciplines  for the Christian Life will guide you through a carefully selected  array of disciplines including Scripture reading, prayer, worship,  Scripture meditation, evangelism, serving, stewardship, Scripture  application, fasting, silence and solitude, journaling, and learning.    <P>By illustrating why the disciplines are important, showing how each  one will help you grown in godliness, and offering practical  suggestions for cultivating them on a long-term basis, Spiritual  Disciplines for the Christian Life will provide you with a refreshing  opportunity to embrace life\'s greatest pursuit-the pursuit of  holiness-through a lifelong delight in the disciplines.'

And even his retrograde comment on the "beauty of the virgin" (which the poet derives from the fact that she "has not yet achieved anything") is counterbalanced by his perception that "the sexes are more related than we think." Those looking for an alluring image of the solitary artist--and for an astonishing quotient of wisdom--will find both in Letters to a Young Poet.'

S'All church leaders have faced the questions that arrive with newcomers:  Do they feel comfortable? Is there more we could do to serve them? Will they want to come back?  Creating an environment that both embraces our newcomers and excites them enough to return does not happen by chance. We must be prepared to be effective stewards of the newcomers God brings us. And, why shouldn t the Church be the epitome of service at its best, as modeled by the greatest server of all time? Built on The Journey Church of the City s Assimilation Seminar, Fusion embodies a step-by-step, biblically grounded, tested and proven plan for establishing a relationship with newcomers that ultimately prompts them to become fully developing members of our congregations. This innovative, practical guide is full of how-to information, testimonials from the recently assimilated and from participating church leaders, examples of the assimilation materials used and check points to make sure the reader is on track.

p9289
S'We aren\'t born again to stay the way we are. But how many times have we looked around us in dismay at the lack of spiritual maturity in fellow believers? It is evident in the rising rate of divorces among Christian couples. We find it in the high percentages of Christians, even pastors, who regularly view pornography. And we face it each time a well-known leader in the Christian community is found in sexual sin or handling finances dishonestly. Perhaps you have struggled with your own character issues for years, even decades, to little avail.    <P>There\'s good news. You can experience significant growth in your Christian walk, shed sinful habits, and increasingly take on the character of Christ. In Renovation of the Heart, best-selling author Dallas Willard calls it "the transformation of the spirit"\x96\x96a divine process that "brings every element in our being, working from inside out, into harmony with the will of God or the kingdom of God." In the transformation of our spirits, we become apprentices of Jesus Christ.    <P>Willard suggests that many Christians today are crying out, "Lord, I want to be a Christian in my heart." If that is your heart\'s cry, this book is the tool to take you to the next level in your quest for true, inward Christlikeness.'

S'<P> Joe Ehrmann, a former NFL football star and volunteer coach for the Gilman high school football team, teaches his players the keys to successful defense: penetrate, pursue, punish, love. Love? A former captain of the Baltimore Colts and now an ordained minister, Ehrmann is serious about the game of football but even more serious about the purpose of life. <I>Season of Life</I> is his inspirational story as told by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Jeffrey Marx, who was a ballboy for the Colts when he first met Ehrmann. <P> Ehrmann now devotes his life to teaching young men a whole new meaning of masculinity. He teaches the boys at Gilman the precepts of his Building Men for Others program: Being a man means emphasizing relationships and having a cause bigger than yourself. It means accepting responsibility and leading courageously. It means that empathy, integrity, and living a life of service to others are more important than points on a scoreboard. <P> Decades after he first met Ehrmann, Jeffrey Marx renewed their friendship and watched his childhood hero putting his principles into action. While chronicling a season with the Gilman Greyhounds, Marx witnessed the most extraordinary sports program he\'d ever seen, where players say "I love you" to each other and coaches profess their love for their players. Off the field Marx sat with Ehrmann and absorbed life lessons that led him to reexamine his own unresolved relationship with his father. <P> <I>Season of Life </I>is a book about what it means to be a man of substance and impact.

p9374
S'Ten years ago a breakthrough book launched a ministry that has helped more than one million people overcome this world and win the battle for their hearts and minds. Now Neil Anderson has revised and expanded Victory over the Darkness for a new generation of readers, outlining practical and more productive ways to Christian growth based on Christ\'s promise: "You will know the truth, and the truth will make you free." Victory Over the Darkness emphasizes the importance of believing and internalizing the cardinal truths of Scripture as a base from which to renew the mind and fend off Satan\'s relentless attempt to convince us that we are less than Christ empowers us to be.'

p9379
S'In many ways, the church today has more consumers than committed participants. We see church merely as an event we attend or an organization we belong to, rather than as a calling that shapes our entire life.    <P>Many of us would be relieved if God had place dour sanctification in the hands of trained professionals, but that simply is not the biblical model. God\x92s plan is that through the faithful ministry of every part, the whole body will grow to maturity in Christ.    <P>Tripp explains how his work follows an "all of my people, all of the time" model. If you followed the Lord for a thousand years, you would still need the ministry of the body of Christ as much as you did the day you first believed. This need will remain until our sanctification is complete in Glory.    <P>This is a comprehensive treatment of how God uses people as tools of change in the lives of others, people who themselves are in need of change.'

p9384
S"The Me I Want to Be by John Ortberg---the bestselling author of When the Game Is Over, It All Goes Back in the Box; God Is Closer Than You Think; and The Life You've Always Wanted---will help you discover spiritual vitality like never before as you learn to 'live in the flow of the spirit.'    But if God has a perfect vision for your life, why does spiritual growth seem so difficult?     John Ortberg has some intriguing answers to that question, and he has organized his thoughts and God's words into a straightforward and timely guide for living your best life in The Me I Want to Be.    This book will show how God's perfect vision for you starts with a powerful promise. All those who trust in God 'will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit' (Jeremiah 17:7-8).    Ortberg urges you to recognize your brokenness, understand that God is the project manager, and follow His directions. The author first helps gauge your spiritual health and measure the gap between where you are now and where God intends you to be. Then he provides detailed tasks and exercises to help you live in the flow of the Spirit, circumventing real-world barriers---pain and sorrow, temptations, self-doubt, sin---to flourish even in a dark and broken world.     As you start living in the flow, you will feel:    --- a deeper connection with God  --- a growing sense of joy  --- an honest recognition of your brokenness  --- less fear, more trust  --- a growing sense of being 'rooted in love'  --- a deeper sense of purpose    God invites you to join Him in crafting an abundant and joy-filled life. The Me I Want to Be shows you how to graciously accept His invitation."

p9399
S"A groundbreaking book about Americans searching for faith and mutual respect, <I>The Faith Club</i> weaves the story of three women, their three religions, and their urgent quest to understand one another.  <P> After September 11, Ranya Idliby, an American Muslim of Palestinian descent, faced constant questions about Islam, God, and death from her children, the only Muslims in their classrooms. Inspired by a story about Muhammad, Ranya reached out to two other mothers to write an interfaith children's book that would highlight the connections between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. After just a few meetings, however, the women realized that they themselves needed an honest and open environment where they could admit -- and discuss -- their concerns, stereotypes, and misunderstandings. After hours of soul-searching about the issues that divided them, Ranya, Suzanne, and Priscilla grew close enough to discover and explore what united them.  <P> A memoir of spiritual reflections in three voices, <I>The Faith Club</i> has spawned interfaith discussion groups in churches, temples, mosques, and other community settings. It will make you feel as if you are eavesdropping on the authors' private thoughts, provocative discussions, and often-controversial opinions and conclusions.  <P> As the authors reveal their deepest beliefs, you watch the blossoming of a profound interfaith friendship and the birth of a new way of relating to others. And this new edition provides all the materials you need for forming your own Faith Club, including sections in Hebrew and Arabic.  <P> Pioneering, timely, deeply thoughtful, and full of hope, <I>The Faith Club</i>'s caring message will resonate with people of all faiths."

For years, she has been the caretaker of her psychotic mother, Camille-the tiara-toting, lipstick-smeared laughingstock of an entire town-a woman trapped in her long-ago moment of glory as the 1951 Vidalia Onion Queen. But when Camille is hit by a truck and killed, CeeCee is left to fend for herself. To the rescue comes her previously unknown great-aunt, Tootie Caldwell. <BR><BR> In her vintage Packard convertible, Tootie whisks CeeCee away to Savannah\'s perfumed world of prosperity and Southern eccentricity, a world that seems to be run entirely by women. From the exotic Miz Thelma Rae Goodpepper, who bathes in her backyard bathtub and uses garden slugs as her secret weapons, to Tootie\'s all-knowing housekeeper, Oletta Jones, to Violene Hobbs, who entertains a local police officer in her canary-yellow peignoir, the women of Gaston Street keep CeeCee entertained and enthralled for an entire summer. <BR><BR> Laugh-out-loud funny and deeply touching, Beth Hoffman\'s sparkling debut is, as Kristin Hannah says, "packed full of Southern charm, strong women, wacky humor, and good old-fashioned heart." It is a novel that explores the indomitable strengths of female friendship and gives us the story of a young girl who loses one mother and finds many others.'

p9473
S'<i>The Wounded Healer</i> is a hope-filled and profoundly simple book that speaks directly to those men and women who want to be of service in their church or community, but have found the traditional ways often threatening and ineffective. In this book, Henri Nouwen combines creative case studies of ministry with stories from diverse cultures and religious traditions in preparing a new model for ministry. Weaving keen cultural analysis with his psychological and religious insights, Nouwen has come up with a balanced and creative theology of service that begins with the realization of fundamental woundedness in human nature. Emphasizing that which is in humanity common to both minister and believer, this woundedness can serve as a source of strength and healing when counseling others. Nouwen proceeds to develop his approach to ministry with an analysis of sufferings -- a suffering world, a suffering generation, a suffering person, and a suffering minister. It is his contention that ministers are called to recognize the sufferings of their time in their own hearts and make that recognition the starting point of their service. For Nouwen, ministers must be willing to go beyond their professional role and leave themselves open as fellow human beings with the same wounds and suffering -- in the image of Christ. In other words, we heal from our own wounds. Filled with examples from everyday experience, <i>The Wounded Healer</i> is a thoughtful and insightful guide that will be welcomed by anyone engaged in the service of others.'

John Perkins should know-he was an economic hit man for an international consulting firm that worked to convince developing countries to accept enormous loans and to funnel that money to U.S. corporations. Once these countries were saddled with huge debts, the American government and international aid agencies were able to request their "pound of flesh" in favors, including access to natural resources, military cooperation, and political support.   <I>Confessions of an Economic Hit Man</I> is the story of one man\'s experiences inside the intrigue, greed, corruption and little-known government and corporate activities that America has been involved in since World War II, and which have dire consequences for the future of democracy and the world.'

S'Jeannette Walls grew up with parents whose ideals and stubborn nonconformity were both their curse and their salvation. Rex and Rose Mary Walls had four children. In the beginning, they lived like nomads, moving among Southwest desert towns, camping in the mountains. Rex was a charismatic, brilliant man who, when sober, captured his children\'s imagination, teaching them physics, geology, and above all, how to embrace life fearlessly. Rose Mary, who painted and wrote and couldn\'t stand the responsibility of providing for her family, called herself an "excitement addict." Cooking a meal that would be consumed in fifteen minutes had no appeal when she could make a painting that might last forever.  <P> Later, when the money ran out, or the romance of the wandering life faded, the Walls retreated to the dismal West Virginia mining town -- and the family -- Rex Walls had done everything he could to escape. He drank. He stole the grocery money and disappeared for days. As the dysfunction of the family escalated, Jeannette and her brother and sisters had to fend for themselves, supporting one another as they weathered their parents\' betrayals and, finally, found the resources and will to leave home.  <P> What is so astonishing about Jeannette Walls is not just that she had the guts and tenacity and intelligence to get out, but that she describes her parents with such deep affection and generosity. Hers is a story of triumph against all odds, but also a tender, moving tale of unconditional love in a family that despite its profound flaws gave her the fiery determination to carve out a successful life on her own terms.  <P> For two decades, Jeannette Walls hid her roots. Now she tells her own story. A regular contributor to MSNBC.com, she lives in New York and Long Island and is married to the writer John Taylor.'

S"Humans and half-bloods alike agree--Percy Jackson and the Olympians is a series fit for heroes! Re-live the adventure from the beginning with this boxed set of the first three books.    <P>The Lightning Thief  Percy Jackson is a good kid, but he can't seem to focus on his schoolwork or control his temper. When his mom tells him the truth about where he came from, she takes him to the one place he'll be safe--Camp Half-Blood, a summer camp for demigods (on Long Island). There, Percy learns that the father he never knew is actually Poseidon, God of the Sea. Soon Percy finds himself caught up in a mystery that could lead to disastrous consequences. Together with his friends--a satyr and other the demigod daughter of Athena--Percy sets out on a quest to reach the gates of the Underworld (located in a recording studio in Hollywood) and prevent a catastrophic war between the gods.    <P>The Sea of Monsters  After a summer spent trying to prevent a catastrophic war among the Greek gods, Percy Jackson finds his seventh-grade school year unnervingly calm. But things don't stay quiet for long. Percy soon discovers there is trouble at Camp Half-Blood: the magical borders which protect Half-Blood Hill have been poisoned by a mysterious enemy, and the only safe haven for demigods is on the verge of being overrun by mythological monsters. To save the camp, Percy needs the help of his best friend, Grover, who has been taken prisoner by the Cyclops Polyphemus on an island somewhere in the Sea of Monsters--the dangerous waters Greek heroes have sailed for millennia--only today, the Sea of Monsters goes by a new nameL: the Bermuda Triangle. Now Percy and his friends must retrieve the Golden Fleece from the Island of the Cyclopes by the end of the summer or Camp Half-Blood will be destroyed. But first, Percy will learn a stunning new secret about his family--one that makes him question whether being claimed as Poseidon's son is an honor or simply a cruel joke...    <P>The Titan's Curse  When Percy Jackson receives a distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he'll need his powerful demigod allies, Annabeth and Thalia, at his side; his trusty broze sword Riptide; and... a ride from his mom. The demigods race to the rescue, to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two new powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that's not all that awaits them. The Titan lord, Kronos, has set up his most devious trap yet, and the young heroes have unwittingly fallen prey. Hilarious and action-packed, this third adventure in the series finds Percy faced with his most dangerous challenge so far: the chilling prophecy of the Titan's curse."

S"With intricate plotting and spine tingling action, <I> The Exile</I> propels us deep into the heart of a terrifying conspiracy rooted in one of the world's most unstable regions--a place where the political has become brutally personal.  .  .<P>For the President of the United States, the daily horror of life in West Darfur, Sudan's anarchic killing fields, just hit heartbreakingly close to home.  His beloved niece Lily, a nurse caring for refugees in the most war-torn region, has been targeted and savagely murdered by a corps of Janjaweed, fearsome government-backed militiamen.<P>The rash and vicious killing is a clear provocation, but any response will seriously destabilize the already-teetering region and threaten the security of the entire world.  With the situation too explosive for diplomatic or military solutions, yet with the President and the public thirsting for revenge, America is out of options.  Except one: Ryan Kealey.<P>Kealey, ex-Special Forces, former CIA, unrivaled counterterrorism expert, has been central to the war on terror for over a decade.  But he's finished trying to save the world. After the Agency hung him out to dry--and let his lover die--it was easy for him to turn his back.  They had nothing he wanted.  Until now. For the government has revealed its trump card, the one thing Kealey will risk everything for.<P>Once back in the fold, Kealey's pursuit of Lily's killers unearths secrets and betrayals that shock even his war-tempered sensibilities and leave him with no-one to trust.  On the lawless streets of Sudan, and at the highest levels of the American government, shadowy forces ignite a conflagration with unknowable global consequences. <P>Brimming with intrigue and danger, <I> The Exile</I>  pulses with high-stakes gamble after gamble, as one man navigates a tenuous web of international relations that could collapse at any moment.  .  ."

S"<blockquote><p><i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell cuts a new edge in suspense with this thrilling tale of passion, danger, and international intrigue in which a pair of former operatives must stop a deadly plot that threatens a major American city\x97and ultimately the world</p></blockquote><p>When she joined St. Kilda's, the elite security consulting firm, Emma Cross thought she'd left behind the blood, the guilt, and the tribal wars that defined her life at the CIA. Yet, trading spying for investigating yacht thefts didn't alleviate the danger\x97or melt away her professional paranoia. Now, the same good instincts that got her into trouble at the agency might be what will help her survive her latest case. </p><p>With some arm-twisting, St. Kilda and Emma are tracking a yacht named <i>Blackbird</i>, a dead ringer for another ship that went missing somewhere between Vladivostok and Portland a year earlier. Emma knows the boat's intended cargo is lethal. What she needs to find out is whether it's biological, chemical, or fissionable. And she's only got seven days to uncover the truth . . . or a major American city will be lost.</p><p>Fortunately, she's working with a new partner as menacing and distrustful as the worst enemy she's ever faced\x97and as deadly. A honed killer, MacKenzie Durand led a special ops team that was deployed to some of the world's nastiest places. But five years ago everything went to hell in Afghanistan, when bad intel hung his team out to dry. The only survivor, Mac walked away and never looked back, preferring to make money sailing high-end boats like <i>Blackbird</i>. </p><p>But Emma and Mac aren't the only eyes watching <i>Blackbird</i>. Taras Demidov, an expert in extortion and execution in the pay of the oligarchs running the former Soviet Union, is also waiting in the shadows, determined to intercept a fearsomely powerful arms dealer with the money, weaponry, and connections to alter the geopolitical balance.</p><p>Thrown together by an organization of enemies with global ties more dangerous than either of them realize, Mac and Emma must put aside their growing attraction for each other to save more than just their own lives. In a deadly game where the rules change without warning and the line between friend and foe is blurred, the pair must find answers fast\x97or watch as innocent civilians are sacrificed in a cold-blooded grab for power and supremacy. And even Mac and Emma aren't sure just who will get to the finish line alive. . . .</p><p>A breathtaking tale of passion and danger, <i>Death Echo</i> is superb entertainment from the queen of suspense, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author Elizabeth Lowell.</p>"

p9651
S'Since its publication in 1982, Old Testament Survey has served as the standard textbook on the background, content, literary quality, and message of the Old Testament. The second edition of this excellent work has been thoroughly revised and updated to take into account new research in the field of Old Testament studies. The book now also includes important new contributions from six leading biblical studies scholars: Leslie C. Allen, James R. Battenfield, John E. Hartley, Robert L. Hubbard Jr., John E. McKenna, and William B. Nelson Jr. Reflecting the best of evangelical scholarship, Old Testament Survey provides a comprehensive study of the nature and contents of each of the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament and also considers the historical data and theological themes relevant to the Hebrew Scriptures. Part 1 covers the five books of the Pentateuch. Part 2 studies the books of the Prophets, with special consideration given to the birth and history of Israel\'s monarchy, the role of prophets and prophecy, and the nature of Hebrew poetry. Part 3 examines the Writings, including a special study of wisdom literature in general. Part 4, which has been relocated from the front of the book to the back, contains studies of various background themes necessary for understanding the Old Testament: "The Authority of the Old Testament for Christians", "Revelation and Inspiration", "The Concept of Canon", "Formation of the Old Testament", "Geography", "The Chronological Puzzle", "Archaeology", and "Messianic Prophecy". All of the revisions and enhancements undertaken in this volume will make Old Testament Survey even more serviceable for college and seminary use as well as for study byscholars, pastors, and interested lay readers.'

(S'John Adams'
p9666
S'<P> In this powerful, epic biography, David McCullough unfolds the adventurous life-journey of John Adams, the brilliant, fiercely independent, often irascible, always honest Yankee patriot -- "the colossus of independence," as Thomas Jefferson called him -- who spared nothing in his zeal for the American Revolution; who rose to become the second President of the United States and saved the country from blundering into an unnecessary war; who was learned beyond all but a few and regarded by some as "out of his senses"; and whose marriage to the wise and valiant Abigail Adams is one of the moving love stories in American history. <P> Like his masterly, Pulitzer Prize-winning biography <I>Truman,</I> David McCullough\'s <I>John Adams</I> has the sweep and vitality of a great novel. It is both a riveting portrait of an abundantly human man and a vivid evocation of his time, much of it drawn from an outstanding collection of Adams family letters and diaries. In particular, the more than one thousand surviving letters between John and Abigail Adams, nearly half of which have never been published, provide extraordinary access to their private lives and make it possible to know John Adams as no other major American of his founding era. <P> As he has with stunning effect in his previous books, McCullough tells the story from within -- from the point of view of the amazing eighteenth century and of those who, caught up in events, had no sure way of knowing how things would turn out. George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, John Jay, the British spy Edward Bancroft, Madame Lafayette and Jefferson\'s Paris "interest" Maria Cosway, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, the scandalmonger James Callender, Sally Hemings, John Marshall, Talleyrand, and Aaron Burr all figure in this panoramic chronicle, as does, importantly, John Quincy Adams, the adored son whom Adams would live to see become President. <P> Crucial to the story, as it was to history, is the relationship between Adams and Jefferson, born opposites -- one a Massachusetts farmer\'s son, the other a Virginia aristocrat and slaveholder, one short and stout, the other tall and spare. Adams embraced conflict; Jefferson avoided it. Adams had great humor; Jefferson, very little. But they were alike in their devotion to their country. <P> At first they were ardent co-revolutionaries, then fellow diplomats and close friends. With the advent of the two political parties, they became archrivals, even enemies, in the intense struggle for the presidency in 1800, perhaps the most vicious election in history. Then, amazingly, they became friends again, and ultimately, incredibly, they died on the same day -- their day of days -- July 4, in the year 1826. <P> Much about John Adams\'s life will come as a surprise to many readers. His courageous voyage on the frigate <I>Boston</I> in the winter of 1778 and his later trek over the Pyrenees are exploits that few would have dared and that few readers will ever forget. <P> It is a life encompassing a huge arc -- Adams lived longer than any president. The story ranges from the Boston Massacre to Philadelphia in 1776 to the Versailles of Louis XVI, from Spain to Amsterdam, from the Court of St. James\'s, where Adams was the first American to stand before King George III as a representative of the new nation, to the raw, half-finished Capital by the Potomac, where Adams was the first President to occupy the White House. <P> This is history on a grand scale -- a book about politics and war and social issues, but also about human nature, love, religious faith, virtue, ambition, friendship and betrayal, and the far-reaching consequences of noble ideas. Above all, <I>John Adams</I> is an enthralling, often surprising story of one of the most important and fascinating Americans who ever lived.'

Often embarrassing and uncomfortable, occasionally outlandish, but most times just a necessary and irresistible evil, the one-night stand is a social rite as old as sex itself and as common as a bar stool.<br><br>Enter Chelsea Handler. Gorgeous, sharp, and anything but shy, Chelsea loves men and lots of them. My Horizontal Life chronicles her romp through the different bedrooms of a variety of suitors, a no-holds-barred account of what can happen between a man and a sometimes very intoxicated, outgoing woman during one night of passion. From her short fling with a Vegas stripper to her even shorter dalliance with a well-endowed little person, from her uncomfortable tryst with a cruise ship performer to her misguided rebound with a man who likes to play leather dress-up, Chelsea recalls the highs and lows of her one-night stands with hilarious honesty. Encouraged by her motley collection of friends (aka: her partners in crime) but challenged by her family members (who at times find themselves a surprise part of the encounter), Chelsea hits bottom and bounces back, unafraid to share the gritty details.

(S'Being Wrong: Adventures in the Margin of Error'
p9741
S'<P>To err is human. Yet most of us go through life assuming (and sometimes insisting) that we are right about nearly everything, from the origins of the universe to how to load the dishwasher. If being wrong is so natural, why are we all so bad at imagining that our beliefs could be mistaken, and why do we react to our errors with surprise, denial, defensiveness, and shame?</P><P>In <I>Being Wrong</I>, journalist Kathryn Schulz explores why we find it so gratifying to be right and so maddening to be mistaken, and how this attitude toward error corrodes relationships\x97whether between family members, colleagues, neighbors, or nations. Along the way, she takes us on a fascinating tour of human fallibility, from wrongful convictions to no-fault divorce; medical mistakes to misadventures at sea; failed prophecies to false memories; "I told you so!" to "Mistakes were made." Drawing on thinkers as varied as Augustine, Darwin, Freud, Gertrude Stein, Alan Greenspan, and Groucho Marx, she proposes a new way of looking at wrongness. In this view, error is both a given and a gift\x97one that can transform our worldviews, our relationships, and, most profoundly, ourselves. </P><P>In the end, <I>Being Wrong</I> is not just an account of human error but a tribute to human creativity\x97the way we generate and revise our beliefs about ourselves and the world. At a moment when economic, political, and religious dogmatism increasingly divide us, Schulz explores with uncommon humor and eloquence the seduction of certainty and the crises occasioned by error. A brilliant debut from a new voice in nonfiction, this book calls on us to ask one of life\'s most challenging questions: what if I\'m wrong?</P>'

(S'Promise, The'
p9746
S'Barack Obama\x92s inauguration as president on January 20, 2009, inspired the world. But the great promise of "Change We Can Believe In" was immediately tested by the threat of another Great Depression, a worsening war in Afghanistan, and an entrenched and deeply partisan system of business as usual in Washington. Despite all the coverage, the backstory of Obama\x92s historic first year in office has until now remained a mystery. <P>In <I>The Promise: President Obama, Year One, </I>Jonathan Alter, one of the country\x92s most respected journalists and historians, uses his unique access to the White House to produce the first inside look at Obama\x92s difficult debut. <P>What happened in 2009 inside the Oval Office? What worked and what failed? What is the president really like on the job and off-hours, using what his best friend called "a Rubik\x92s Cube in his brain"? These questions are answered here for the first time. We see how a surprisingly cunning Obama took effective charge in Washington several weeks before his election, made trillion-dollar decisions on the stimulus and budget before he was inaugurated, engineered colossally unpopular bailouts of the banking and auto sectors, and escalated a treacherous war not long after settling into office. <P><I>The Promise </I>is a fast-paced and incisive narrative of a young risk-taking president carving his own path amid sky-high expectations and surging joblessness. Alter reveals that it was Obama alone\x97"feeling lucky"\x97who insisted on pushing major health care reform over the objections of his vice president and top advisors, including his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, who admitted that "I begged him not to do this." <P><P>Alter takes the reader inside the room as Obama prevents a fistfight involving a congressman, coldly reprimands the military brass for insubordination, crashes the key meeting at the Copenhagen Climate Change conference, and realizes that a Senate candidate\x92s gaffe about baseball in a Massachusetts special election will dash the big dream of his first year.<P>In Alter\x92s telling, the real Obama is an authentic, demanding, unsentimental, and sometimes overconfident leader. He adapted to the presidency with ease and put more "points on the board" than he is given credit for, but neglected to use his leverage over the banks and failed to connect well with an angry public. We see the famously calm president cursing leaks, playfully trash-talking his advisors, and joking about even the most taboo subjects, still intent on redeeming more of his promise as the problems mount. <P><P>This brilliant blend of journalism and history offers the freshest reporting and most acute perspective on the biggest story of our time. It will shape impressions of the Obama presidency and of the man himself for years to come.'

S"<div>The call to preach is just that - a call to preach. The call to preach, however, is more than just preaching.  The call to preach is a call to prepare. Too many pastors have refrained from preparation while they await the Holy Spirit to do all of the work.God expects preachers to prepare sermons as much as possible and allow Him to prepare the preachers.Join Dr. Jerry Vines and Dr. Jim Shaddix as they achieve a balanced approach to teaching sermon preparation in Power in the Pulpit. Combines the essential perspectives of a pastor of forty years with another pastor who also devotes daily time to training pastors in the context of theological education. Thus, Power in the Pulpit is a practical preaching help from a pastoral perspective in the tradition where expository preaching is a paramount and frequent event in the life of the local church.Power in the Pulpit is the combined work of Dr. Vines's two earlier publications on preaching: A Practical Guide to Sermon Preparation (Moody Press, 1985) and A Guide to Effective Sermon Delivery (Moody Press, 1986). Dr. Shaddix carefully organizes and supplements the material to offer this useful resource which closes the gap between classroom theory and what a pastor experiences in his weekly sermon preparation.</div>"

S"<p>In <i>97 Orchard</i>, Jane Ziegelman explores the culinary life that was the heart and soul of New York's Lower East Side around the turn of the twentieth century\x97a city within a city, where Germans, Irish, Italians, and Eastern European Jews attempted to forge a new life. Through the experiences of five families, all of them residents of 97 Orchard Street, she takes readers on a vivid and unforgettable tour, from impossibly cramped tenement apartments down dimly lit stairwells where children played and neighbors socialized, beyond the front stoops where immigrant housewives found respite and company, and out into the hubbub of the dirty, teeming streets.</p><p>Ziegelman shows how immigrant cooks brought their ingenuity to the daily task of feeding their families, preserving traditions from home but always ready to improvise. While health officials worried that pushcarts were unsanitary and that pickles made immigrants too excitable to be good citizens, a culinary revolution was taking place in the streets of what had been culturally an English city. Along the East River, German immigrants founded breweries, dispensing their beloved lager in the dozens of beer gardens that opened along the Bowery. Russian Jews opened tea parlors serving blintzes and strudel next door to Romanian nightclubs that specialized in goose pastrami. On the streets, Italian peddlers hawked the cheese-and-tomato pies known as <i>pizzarelli</i>, while Jews sold knishes and squares of halvah. Gradually, as Americans began to explore the immigrant ghetto, they uncovered the array of comestible enticements of their foreign-born neighbors. <i>97 Orchard</i> charts this exciting process of discovery as it lays bare the roots of our collective culinary heritage.</p>"

S"Now, readers of the Bible who are interested in studying Jewish traditions have a one-volume resource specifically tailored for their needs. The Jewish Study Bible presents the center of gravity of the Scriptures where Jews experience it--in Torah. It offers readers the fruits of various schools of Jewish traditions of biblical exegesis (rabbinic, medieval, mystical, etc.) and provides them with a wealth of ancillary materials that aid in bringing the ancient text to life. The nearly forty contributors to the work represent the cream of Jewish biblical scholarship from the world over. No knowledge of Hebrew is required for one to make use of this unique volume. The JSB uses The Jewish Publication Society TANAKH Translation, whose name is an acronym formed from the Hebrew initials of the three sections into which the Hebrew Bible is traditionally divided (Torah, Instruction; Nevi'im, Prophets; and Kethubim, Writings). A committee of esteemed biblical scholars and rabbis from the Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform Judaism movements produced this modern translation, which dates from 1985. Anyone interested in acquiring a fuller understanding of the riches of the Bible will profit from reading The Jewish Study Bible."

p9838
S'In the universally acclaimed and award-winning </em>The Bottom Billion</em>, Paul Collier reveals that fifty failed states--home to the poorest one billion people on Earth--pose the central challenge of the developing world in the twenty-first century. The book shines much-needed light on this group of small nations, largely unnoticed by the industrialized West, that are dropping further and further behind the majority of the world\'s people, often falling into an absolute decline in living standards. A struggle rages within each of these nations between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, pointing to a set of traps that ensnare these countries, including civil war, a dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources, and bad governance. Standard solutions do not work, he writes; aid is often ineffective, and globalization can actually make matters worse, driving development to more stable nations. What the bottom billion need, Collier argues, is a bold new plan supported by the Group of Eight industrialized nations. If failed states are ever to be helped, the G8 will have to adopt preferential trade policies, new laws against corruption, new international charters, and even conduct carefully calibrated military interventions. Collier has spent a lifetime working to end global poverty. In </em>The Bottom Billion</em>, he offers real hope for solving one of the great humanitarian crises facing the world today.<br><br></strong>"Terrifically readable."</strong><br>--</em>Time.com</em><br><br></strong>"Set to become a classic. Crammed with statistical nuggets and common sense, his book should be compulsory reading."</strong><br>--</em>The Economist</em><br><br></strong>"If Sachs seems too saintly and Easterly too cynical, then Collier is the authentic old Africa hand: he knows the terrain and has a keen ear.... If you\'ve ever found yourself on one side or the other of those arguments--and who hasn\'t?--then you simply must read this book."</strong><br>--Niall Ferguson, </em>The New York Times Book Review</em><br><br></strong>"Rich in both analysis and recommendations....

Living with the Clan has taught Ayla many skills but not real hunting. She finally knows she can survive when she traps a horse, which gives her meat and a warm pelt for the winter, but fate has bestowed a greater gift, an orphaned foal with whom she develops a unique kinship. One winter extends to more; she discovers a way to make fire more quickly and a wounded cave lion cub joins her unusual family, but her beloved animals don\x92t fulfill her restless need for human companionship. Then she hears the sound of a man screaming in pain.

p9848
S'<I>The Way We\x92re Working Isn\x92t Working </I>is one of those rare books with the power to profoundly transform the way we work and live. <P>Demand is exceeding our capacity. The ethic of "more, bigger, faster" exacts a series of silent but pernicious costs at work, undermining our energy, focus, creativity, and passion. Nearly 75 percent of employees around the world feel disengaged at work every day. <I>The Way We\x92re Working Isn\x92t Working </I>offers a groundbreaking approach to reenergizing our lives so we\x92re both more satisfied and more productive\x97on the job and off. <P>By integrating multidisciplinary findings from the science of high performance, Tony Schwartz, coauthor of the #1 bestselling <I>The Power of Full Engagement, </I>makes a persuasive case that we\x92re neglecting the four core needs that energize great performance: sustainability (physical); security (emotional); self-expression (mental); and significance (spiritual). Rather than running like computers at high speeds for long periods, we\x92re at our best when we pulse rhythmically between expending and regularly renewing energy across each of our four needs. <P>Organizations undermine sustainable high performance by forever seeking to get more out of their people.

At the individual level, he explains how we can build specific rituals into our daily schedules to balance intense effort with regular renewal; offset emotionally draining experiences with practices that fuel resilience; move between a narrow focus on urgent demands and more strategic, creative thinking; and balance a short-term focus on immediate results with a values-driven commitment to serving the greater good. At the organizational level, he outlines new policies, practices, and cultural messages that Schwartz\x92s client companies have adopted. <P><I>The Way We\x92re Working Isn\x92t Working </I>offers individuals, leaders, and organizations a highly practical, proven set of strategies to better manage the relentlessly rising demands we all face in an increasingly complex world.'

And many believe these shifts are doing more than just rocking the political and social climate; they're rocking the American core. </p> <p> What are these changes? Who, in addition to President Obama, have been the biggest forces behind them? What exactly do they mean for you, the everyday American citizen? How are they affecting your money, health, safety, freedom, and standing in this nation? Which are Pinheaded moves and which are truly Patriotic? In his latest spirited book, O'Reilly prompts further debate with the President and the American people on the current state of the union. </p> <p> After five consecutive, no-nonsense, tell-it-like-it-is megabestsellers, you can count on Bill to offer blunt and constructive political commentary. And as he did in his popular memoir, he offers some introspection too, looking back at his own actions and those of past Pinheads and Patriots who have inspired a code of conduct for such taxing times. </p> <p> As always, O'Reilly is fair, balanced, and uncompromisingly tough when guarding the American way. Only Pinheads would fail to fight for what they love most about this country or to embrace some measure of change to make it better.

p9898
S'<DIV><p>The decline of cheap oil is inspiring increasing numbers of North Americans to achieve some measure of backyard food self-sufficiency. In hard times, the family can be greatly helped by growing a highly productive food garden, requiring little cash outlay or watering.</p> <p>Currently popular intensive vegetable gardening methods are largely inappropriate to this new circumstance. Crowded raised beds require high inputs of water, fertility and organic matter, and demand large amounts of human time and effort. But, except for labor, these inputs depend on the price of oil. Prior to the 1970s, North American home food growing used more land with less labor, with wider plant spacing, with less or no irrigation, and all done with sharp hand tools. But these sustainable systems have been largely forgotten. <i>Gardening When It Counts</i> helps readers rediscover traditional low-input gardening methods to produce healthy food.</p> <p>Designed for readers with no experience and applicable to most areas in the English-speaking world except the tropics and hot deserts, this book shows that any family with access to 3-5,000 sq. ft. of garden land can halve their food costs using a growing system requiring just the odd bucketful of household waste water, perhaps two hundred dollars worth of hand tools, and about the same amount spent on supplies \x97 working an average of two hours a day during the growing season.</p> <p><b>Steve Solomon</b> is a well-known west coast gardener and author of five previous books, including <i>Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades</i> which has appeared in five editions.</p></DIV>'

S"A child caught in the horror of alcohol and drug addition. A mother helplessly standing by unable to save her.  The Lost Years is the real life story of just such a mother and child, each giving their first-hand accounts of the years lost to addiction and despair. Kristina, the second of four children, tells how she turns to alcohol for comfort when she is thirteen. She gives a brutally honest description of her descent into addiction, prostitution, burglary and violent rape until her near death on the floor of a homeless shelter completely alone at the age of twenty-one.  Adding a heart-wrenching counterpart to the story, Kristina's mother, Connie, tells of her powerlessness to help her addicted daughter, the break-up of her unhappy marriage and how she comes to terms with her own co-dependency.  She is also faced with the worst choice a mother has to make, to close the door on Kristina, sending her onto the streets in order to save herself and protect her other children. Then follows the remarkable story of Kristina's recovery as she lives through rehab, her mother's tough love and the years of acclimating herself to living a normal life."

She examines how the practice is related to the classic tradition of Christian contemplation, looks at the distinct nuances of its method, and explores its revolutionary potential to transform Christian life. The book encourages dialogue between Centering Prayer enthusiasts and those classic institutions of Christian nurture--churches, seminaries, and schools of theology--that have yet to accept real ownership of the practice and its potential.'

There, exiled from his beloved olive groves, the family patriarch languishes of a broken heart, his eldest son fathers a family and falls victim to an Israeli bullet, and his grandchildren struggle against tragedy toward freedom, peace, and home. This is the Palestinian story, told as never before, through four generations of a single family. <P></P>The very precariousness of existence in the camps quickens life itself. Amal, the patriarch's bright granddaughter, feels this with certainty when she discovers the joys of young friendship and first love and especially when she loses her adored father, who read to her daily as a young girl in the quiet of the early dawn. Through Amal we get the stories of her twin brothers, one who is kidnapped by an Israeli soldier and raised Jewish; the other who sacrifices everything for the Palestinian cause. Amal\x92s own dramatic story threads between the major Palestinian-Israeli clashes of three decades; it is one of love and loss, of childhood, marriage, and parenthood, and finally of the need to share her history with her daughter, to preserve the greatest love she has. <P></P>Previously published in a hardcover edition with a limited run under the title <I>The Scar of David</I>, this powerful novel is now available in a fully revised, newly titled paperback edition.

S'<P> The life of Harry S. Truman is one of the greatest of American stories, filled with vivid characters -- Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, Eleanor Roosevelt, Bess Wallace Truman, George Marshall, Joe McCarthy, and Dean Acheson -- and dramatic events. In this riveting biography, acclaimed historian David McCullough not only captures the man -- a more complex, informed, and determined man than ever before imagined -- but also the turbulent times in which he rose, boldly, to meet unprecedented challenges. The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Truman\'s story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur. Drawing on newly discovered archival material and extensive interviews with Truman\'s own family, friends, and Washington colleagues, McCullough tells the deeply moving story of the seemingly ordinary "man from Missouri" who was perhaps the most courageous president in our history.'

S'<B>A brilliant, authoritative, and fascinating history of America\x92s most puzzling era, the years 1920 to 1933, when the U.S. Constitution was amended to restrict one of America\x92s favorite pastimes: drinking alcoholic beverages. <P></B>From its start, America has been awash in drink. The sailing vessel that brought John Winthrop to the shores of the New World in 1630 carried more beer than water. By the 1820s, liquor flowed so plentifully it was cheaper than tea. That Americans would <I>ever </I>agree to relinquish their booze was as improbable as it was astonishing. <P>Yet we did, and <I>Last Call </I>is Daniel Okrent\x92s dazzling explanation of why we did it, what life under Prohibition was like, and how such an unprecedented degree of government interference in the private lives of Americans changed the country forever. <P>Writing with both wit and historical acuity, Okrent reveals how Prohibition marked a confluence of diverse forces: the growing political power of the women\x92s suffrage movement, which allied itself with the antiliquor campaign; the fear of small-town, native-stock Protestants that they were losing control of their country to the immigrants of the large cities; the anti-German sentiment stoked by World War I; and a variety of other unlikely factors, ranging from the rise of the automobile to the advent of the income tax. <P>Through it all, Americans kept drinking, going to remarkably creative lengths to smuggle, sell, conceal, and convivially (and sometimes fatally) imbibe their favorite intoxicants. <I>Last Call </I>is peopled with vivid characters of an astonishing variety: Susan B. Anthony and Billy Sunday, William Jennings Bryan and bootlegger Sam Bronfman, Pierre S. du Pont and H. L. Mencken, Meyer Lansky and the incredible\x97if long-forgotten\x97federal official Mabel Walker Willebrandt, who throughout the twenties was the most powerful woman in the country. (Perhaps most surprising of all is Okrent\x92s account of Joseph P. Kennedy\x92s legendary, and long-misunderstood, role in the liquor business.) <P>It\x92s a book rich with stories from nearly all parts of the country. Okrent\x92s narrative runs through smoky Manhattan speakeasies, where relations between the sexes were changed forever; California vineyards busily producing \x93sacramental\x94 wine; New England fishing communities that gave up fishing for the more lucrative rum-running business; and in Washington, the halls of Congress itself, where politicians who had voted for Prohibition drank openly and without apology. <P><I>Last Call </I>is capacious, meticulous, and thrillingly told. It stands as the most complete history of Prohibition ever written and confirms Daniel Okrent\x92s rank as a major American writer.'

S'Many language books are boring--this one is not. Written by a native English speaker who learned Spanish the hard way--by trying to talk to Spanish-speaking people--it offers English speakers with a basic knowledge of Spanish hundreds of tips for using the language more fluently and colloquially, with fewer obvious "gringo" errors.   Writing with humor, common sense, and a minimum of jargon, Joseph Keenan covers everything from pronunciation, verb usage, and common grammatical mistakes to the subtleties of addressing other people, "trickster" words that look alike in both languages, inadvertent obscenities, and intentional swearing. He guides readers through the set phrases and idiomatic expressions that pepper the native speaker\'s conversation and provides a valuable introduction to the most widely used Spanish slang.   With this book, both students in school and adult learners who never want to see another classroom can rapidly improve their speaking ability. Breaking Out of Beginner\'s Spanish will be an essential aid in passing the supreme language test--communicating fluently with native speakers.'

p10117
S'<P>One of the vital challenges facing thoughtful people today is how to read the Bible faithfully without abandoning our sense of truth and history. <i>Reading the Bible Again for the First Time</I> provides a much-needed solution to the problem of how to have a fully authentic yet contemporary understanding of the scriptures. Many mistakenly believe there are no choices other than fundamentalism or simply rejecting the Bible as something that can bring meaning to our lives. Answering this modern dilemma, acclaimed author Marcus Borg reveals how it is possible to reconcile the Bible with both a scientific and critical way of thinking and our deepest spiritual needs, leading to a contemporary yet grounded experience of the sacred texts.</P> <P>This seminal book shows you how to read the Bible as it should be examined\x97in an approach the author calls "historical-metaphorical." Borg explores what the Scriptures meant to the ancient communities that produced and lived by them. He then helps us to discover the meaning of these stories, providing the knowledge and perspective to make the wisdom of the Bible an essential part of our modern lives. The author argues that the conventional way of seeing the Bible\'s origin, authority, and interpretation has become unpersuasive to millions of people in our time, and that we need a fresh way of encountering the Bible that takes the texts seriously but not literally, even as it takes seriously who we have become.</P> <P>Borg traces his personal spiritual journey, describing for readers how he moved from an unquestioning childhood belief in the biblical stories to a more powerful and dynamic relationship with the Bible as a sacred text brimming with meaning and guidance. Using his own experience as an example, he reveals how the modern crisis of faith is itself rooted in the misinterpretation of sacred texts as historical record and divine dictation, and opens readers to a truer, more abundant perspective.</P> <P>This unique book invites everyone\x97whatever one\'s religious background\x97to engage the Bible, wrestle with its meaning, explore its mysteries, and understand its relevance. Borg shows us how to encounter the Bible in a fresh way that rejects the limits of simple literalism and opens up rich possibilities for our lives.</P>'

(S'A Geography of Time: The Temporal Misadventures of a Social Psychologist, or How Every Culture Keeps Time Just a Little Bit Differently'
p10142
S'<DIV>In this engaging and spirited book, eminent social psychologist Robert Levine asks us to explore a dimension of our experience that we take for granted?our perception of time. When we travel to a different country, or even a different city in the United States, we assume that a certain amount of cultural adjustment will be required, whether it\x92s getting used to new food or negotiating a foreign language, adapting to a different standard of living or another currency. In fact, what contributes most to our sense of disorientation is having to adapt to another culture\x92s sense of time.Levine, who has devoted his career to studying time and the pace of life, takes us on an enchanting tour of time through the ages and around the world. As he recounts his unique experiences with humor and deep insight, we travel with him to Brazil, where to be three hours late is perfectly acceptable, and to Japan, where he finds a sense of the long-term that is unheard of in the West. We visit communities in the United States and find that population size affects the pace of life?and even the pace of walking. We travel back in time to ancient Greece to examine early clocks and sundials, then move forward through the centuries to the beginnings of \x94clock time\x94 during the Industrial Revolution. We learn that there are places in the world today where people still live according to \x94nature time,\x94 the rhythm of the sun and the seasons, and \x94event time,\x94 the structuring of time around happenings(when you want to make a late appointment in Burundi, you say, \x94I\x92ll see you when the cows come in\x94).Levine raises some fascinating questions. How do we use our time? Are we being ruled by the clock? What is this doing to our cities? To our relationships? To our own bodies and psyches? Are there decisions we have made without conscious choice? Alternative tempos we might prefer? Perhaps, Levine argues, our goal should be to try to live in a \x94multitemporal\x94 society, one in which we learn to move back and forth among nature time, event time, and clock time. In other words, each of us must chart our own geography of time. If we can do that, we will have achieved temporal prosperity.</Div>'

S'Based on Gabor Mat\xe9\x92s two decades of experience as a medical doctor and his groundbreaking work with the severely addicted on Vancouver\x92s skid row, <i>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts</i> radically reenvisions this much misunderstood field by taking a holistic approach. Dr. Mat\xe9 presents addiction not as a discrete phenomenon confined to an unfortunate or weak-willed few, but as a continuum that runs throughout (and perhaps underpins) our society; not a medical "condition" distinct from the lives it affects, rather the result of a complex interplay among personal history, emotional, and neurological development, brain chemistry, and the drugs (and behaviors) of addiction. Simplifying a wide array of brain and addiction research findings from around the globe, the book avoids glib self-help remedies, instead promoting a thorough and compassionate self-understanding as the first key to healing and wellness. <br><br><i>In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts </i>argues persuasively against contemporary health, social, and criminal justice policies toward addiction and those impacted by it. The mix of personal stories\x97including the author\x92s candid discussion of his own "high-status" addictive tendencies\x97and science with positive solutions makes the book equally useful for lay readers and professionals.'

He foreshadowed the fact that he was going to be 'broken' and 'poured out'---he was going to take humanity's punishment for sin on himself.     While they were eating, Jesus took bread, and when he had given thanks, he broke it and gave it to his disciples, saying, 'Take and eat; this is my body.'     Then he took the cup, and when he had given thanks, he gave it to them, saying, 'Drink from it, all of you. This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. I tell you, I will not drink of this fruit of the vine from now on until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.'     Jesus warned his disciples that he would be with them only a little while longer. He went on to comfort his confused followers.     'Do not let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God; trust also in me. My Father's house has plenty of room; if that were not so, would I have told you that I am going there to prepare a place for you? And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back and take you to be with me that you also may be where I am. You know the way to the place where I am going.'     Thomas said to him, 'Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?'     Jesus answered, 'I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really know me, you will know my Father as well. From now on, you do know him and have seen him.'"

p10207
S'<DIV><DIV><P>In <I>The Subtle Body</I>, Stefanie Syman tells the surprising story of yoga\x92s transformation from a centuries-old spiritual discipline to a multibillion-dollar American industry.<BR><BR>Yoga\x92s history in America is longer and richer than even its most devoted practitioners realize. It was present in Emerson\x92s New England, and by the turn of the twentieth century it was fashionable among the leisure class. And yet when Americans first learned about yoga, what they learned was that it was a dangerous, alien practice that would corrupt body and soul.<BR><BR>A century later, you can find yoga in gyms, malls, and even hospitals, and the arrival of a yoga studio in a neighborhood is a signal of cosmopolitanism. How did it happen? It did so, Stefanie Syman explains, through a succession of charismatic yoga teachers, who risked charges of charlatanism as they promoted yoga in America, and through generations of yoga students, who were deemed unbalanced or even insane for their efforts. <I>The Subtle Body </I>tells the stories of these people, including Henry David Thoreau, Pierre A. Bernard, Margaret Woodrow Wilson, Christopher Isherwood, Sally Kempton, and Indra Devi.<BR><BR>From New England, the book moves to New York City and its new suburbs between the wars, to colonial India, to postwar Los Angeles, to Haight-Ashbury in its heyday, and back to New York City post-9/11. In vivid chapters, it takes in celebrities from Gloria Swanson and George Harrison to Christy Turlington and Madonna. And it offers a fresh view of American society, showing how a seemingly arcane and foreign practice is as deeply rooted here as baseball or ballet.<BR><BR>This epic account of yoga\x92s rise is absorbing and often inspiring\x97a major contribution to our understanding of our society.</P></DIV></DIV>'

p10232
S'On September 30, 2006 gunfire echoed through the thin air near Advance Base Camp on Cho Oyu Mountain. Frequented by thousands of climbers each year, Cho Oyu lies nineteen miles east of Mt. Everest on the border between Tibet and Nepal. To the elite mountaineering community, it offers a straightforward summit-a warm-up climb to her formidable sister. To Tibetans, Cho Oyu promises a gateway to freedom through a secret glacial path: the Nangpa La. Murder in the High Himalaya is the unforgettable account of the brutal killing of Kelsang Namtso-a seventeen-year-old Tibetan nun fleeing to India-by Chinese border guards. Witnessed by dozens of Western climbers, Kelsang-s death sparked an international debate over China-s savage oppression of Tibet. Adventure reporter Jonathan Green has gained rare entrance into this shadow-land at the rooftop of the world. In his affecting portrait of modern Tibet, Green raises enduring questions about morality and the lengths we go to achieve freedom.'

S'"God spoke to me."    "The Spirit spoke to my heart."    "God revealed the idea to me."    Being close to God means communicating with him--telling him what is on our hearts in prayer and hearing and understanding what he is saying to us. It is this second half of our conversation with God that is so important but that can also be so difficult. How do we hear his voice? How can we be sure that what we think we hear is not our own subconscious? What role does the Bible play? What if what God says to us is not clear?    The key, says best-selling author Dallas Willard, is to focus not so much on individual actions and decisions as on building our personal relationship with our Creator. In this updated classic, originally published as In Search of Guidance, the author provides rich spiritual insight into how we can hear God\'s voice clearly and develop an intimate partnership with him in the work of his kingdom.

S'<B>"The only way to get what you\'re worth is to stand out, to exert emotional labor, to be seen as indispensable, and to produce interactions that organizations and people care deeply about."</B> <BR><BR> In bestsellers such as <I>Purple Cow</I> and <I>Tribes</I>, Seth Godin taught readers how to make remarkable products and spread powerful ideas. But this book is different. It\'s about you - your choices, your future, and your potential to make a huge difference in whatever field you choose. <BR><BR> There used to be two teams in every workplace: management and labor. Now there\'s a third team, the linchpins. These people invent, lead (regardless of title), connect others, make things happen, and create order out of chaos. They figure out what to do when there\'s no rule book. They delight and challenge their customers and peers. They love their work, pour their best selves into it, and turn each day into a kind of art. <BR><BR> Linchpins are the essential building blocks of great organizations. Like the small piece of hardware that keeps a wheel from falling off its axle, they may not be famous but they\'re indispensable. And in today\'s world, they get the best jobs and the most freedom. <BR><BR> Have you ever found a shortcut that others missed? Seen a new way to resolve a conflict? Made a connection with someone others couldn\'t reach? Even once? Then you have what it takes to become indispensable, by overcoming the resistance that holds people back. <I>Linchpin</I> will show you how to join the likes of... <BR><BR> *Keith Johnson, who scours flea markets across the country to fill Anthropologie stores with unique pieces. <BR> *Marissa Mayer, who keeps Google focused on the things that really matter. <BR> *Jason Zimdars, a graphic designer who got his dream job at 37signals without a r\xe9sum\xe9. <BR> *David, who works at Dean and Deluca coffeeshop in New York. He sees every customer interaction as a chance to give a gift and is cherished in return. <BR><BR> As Godin writes, "Every day I meet people who have so much to give but have been bullied enough or frightened enough to hold it back. It\'s time to stop complying with the system and draw your own map. You have brilliance in you, your contribution is essential, and the art you create is precious. Only you can do it, and you must."'

To Allon, there is something terribly familiar about the information, something horrifyingly close--but even he does not realize how close. Urgently, he throws himself into the hunt, but there may simply not be enough of anything: enough time, enough facts, enough luck.

With practical suggestions, Mahaney demonstrates the difference between knowing the gospel... and making it the main thing in daily decisions and daily living.'

And this time, the message is urgent and impossible to ignore River requires open-heart surgery, and Isabelle and her sisters are needed at home to run the family bakery and take care of their brother and ailing grandmother. <P>Isabelle has worked hard to leave Trillium River, Oregon, behind as she travels the globe taking award-winning photographs. It's not that Isabelle hates her family. On the contrary, she and her sisters Cecilia, an outspoken kindergarten teacher, and Janie, a bestselling author, share a deep, loving bond. And all of them adore their brother, Henry, whose disabilities haven't stopped him from helping out at the bakery and bringing good cheer to everyone in town. <P>But going home again has a way of forcing open the secrets and hurts that the Bommaritos would rather keep tightly closed Isabelle's fleeting and too-frequent relationships, Janie's obsessive compulsive disorder, and Cecilia's self-destructive streak and grief over her husband's death. Working together to look after Henry and save their flagging bakery, Isabelle and her sisters begin to find answers to questions they never knew existed, unexpected ways to salve the wounds of their childhoods, and the courage to grasp surprising new chances at happiness. <P>Poignant, funny, and as irresistible as one of the Bommarito sisters' delicious giant cupcakes, Henry's Sisters is a novel about family and forgiveness, about mothers and daughters, and about gaining the wisdom to look ahead while still holding tight to everything that matters most."

Your symptoms may be signals that something in your life needs to change. Learning to understand and interpret these signals is much more important than ignoring or avoiding them--approaches that only make the situation worse.

C. Gwynne\x92s <I>Empire of the Summer Moon</I><B> </B>spans two astonishing stories. The first traces the rise and fall of the Comanches, the most powerful Indian tribe in American history. The second entails one of the most remarkable narratives ever to come out of the Old West: the epic saga of the pioneer woman Cynthia Ann Parker and her mixed-blood son Quanah, who became the last and greatest chief of the Comanches. <P>Although readers may be more familiar with the tribal names Apache and Sioux, it was in fact the legendary fighting ability of the Comanches that determined just how and when the American West opened up. Comanche boys became adept bareback riders by age six; full Comanche braves were considered the best horsemen who ever rode. They were so masterful at war and so skillful with their arrows and lances that they stopped the northern drive of colonial Spain from Mexico and halted the French expansion westward from Louisiana. White settlers arriving in Texas from the eastern United States were surprised to find the frontier being rolled <I>backward </I>by Comanches incensed by the invasion of their tribal lands. So effective were the Comanches that they forced the creation of the Texas Rangers and account for the advent of the new weapon specifically designed to fight them: the six-gun. <P>The war with the Comanches lasted four decades, in effect holding up the development of the new American nation. Gwynne\x92s exhilarating account delivers a sweeping narrative that encompasses Spanish colonialism, the Civil War, the destruction of the buffalo herds, and the arrival of the railroads\x97a historical feast for anyone interested in how the United States came into being. <P>Against this backdrop Gwynne presents the compelling drama of Cynthia Ann Parker, a lovely nine-year-old girl with cornflower-blue eyes who was kidnapped by Comanches from the far Texas frontier in 1836. She grew to love her captors and became infamous as the "White Squaw" who refused to return until her tragic capture by Texas Rangers in 1860. More famous still was her son Quanah, a warrior who was never defeated and whose guerrilla wars in the Texas Panhandle made him a legend. <P><P>S. C. Gwynne\x92s account of these events is meticulously researched, intellectually provocative, and, above all, thrillingly told. <I>Empire of the Summer Moon </I>announces him as a major new writer of American history.'

In sheltered isolation, guided solely by the influence of the Station's heroic all-black crewmen, she blossoms into a strong and beautiful young woman with a spirit to match. But Sunday's secluded paradise cannot last. Her calm, simple days by the sea must inevitably give way to the fast-approaching storms of life. Unexpectedly, those darkening skies bring with them an unlikely mix of forbidden love, murder, and revenge along with a Nazi submarine carrying millions of dollars in gold stolen from Hitler's Third Reich.

Young children enjoy playing with imaginary friends and can be comforted by security blankets. People slow their cars to look at gory accidents, and go to movies that make them cry.In this fascinating and witty account, Paul Bloom examines the science behind these curious desires, attractions, and tastes, covering everything from the animal instincts of sex and food to the uniquely human taste for art, music, and stories.

Elaine, one of the top witches in the U.S., clashed with Dr. Brown, who stood against her alone. In the titanic life-and-death struggle that followed, Dr. Brown nearly lost her life. Elaine, finding a power and love greater than anything Satan could give her, left Satan and totally committed her life to Jesus Christ. In this honest, in-depth account of Satan's activities today, you'll see how to recognize and combat the many satanists who regularly infiltrate and destroy Christian churches; recognize and combat satanic attacks; and recognize those serving Satan, and bring them to Jesus Christ."

p10685
S'<DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV><DIV>In the early 1770s, the men who invented America were living quiet, provincial lives in the rustic backwaters of the New World, devoted primarily to family, craft, and the private pursuit of wealth and happiness. None set out to become "revolutionary" by ambition, but when events in Boston escalated, they found themselves thrust into a crisis that moved, in a matter of months, from protest to war. <P></P>In this remarkable book, the historian Jack Rakove shows how the private lives of these men were suddenly transformed into public careers\x97how Washington became a strategist, Franklin a pioneering cultural diplomat, Madison a sophisticated constitutional thinker, and Hamilton a brilliant policymaker. Rakove shakes off accepted notions of these men as godlike visionaries, focusing instead on the evolution of their ideas and the crystallizing of their purpose. In <I>Revolutionaries</I>, we see the founders <I>before</I> they were fully formed leaders, as individuals whose lives were radically altered by the explosive events of the mid-1770s. They were ordinary men who became extraordinary\x97a transformation that finally has the literary treatment it deserves. <P></P>Spanning the two crucial decades of the country\x92s birth, from 1773 to 1792, <I>Revolutionaries</I> uses little-known stories of these famous (and not so famous) men to capture\x97in a way no single biography ever could\x97the intensely creative period of the republic\x92s founding. From the Boston Tea Party to the First Continental Congress, from Trenton to Valley Forge, from the ratification of the Constitution to the disputes that led to our two-party system, Rakove explores the competing views of politics, war, diplomacy, and society that shaped our nation. <P></P>Thoughtful, clear-minded, and persuasive, <I>Revolutionaries</I> is a majestic blend of narrative and intellectual history, one of those rare books that makes us think afresh about how the country came to be, and why the idea of America endures. <P></P></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV></DIV>'

p10700
S'<DIV>Something scary is happening to boys today. From kindergarten to college, American boys are, on average, less resilient and less ambitious than they were a mere twenty years ago. The gender gap in college attendance and graduation rates has widened dramatically. While Emily is working hard at school and getting A\x92s, her brother Justin is goofing off. He\x92s more concerned about getting to the next level in his videogame than about finishing his homework. Now, Dr. Leonard Sax delves into the scientific literature and draws on more than twenty years of clinical experience to explain why boys and young men are failing in school and disengaged at home. He shows how social, cultural, and biological factors have created an environment that is literally toxic to boys. He also presents practical solutions, sharing strategies which educators have found effective in re-engaging these boys at school, as well as handy tips for parents about everything from homework, to videogames, to medication.</DIV>'

But instead of feeling happy and fulfilled, she was   consumed with panic, grief, and confusion. She went through a divorce, a crushing depression,   another failed love, and the eradication of everything she ever thought she was supposed to be.  <P>  To recover from all this, Gilbert took a radical step.

In Rome, she studied the art of pleasure, learning to speak Italian and gaining the   twenty-three happiest pounds of her life. India was for the art of devotion, and with the help of a   native guru and a surprisingly wise cowboy from Texas, she embarked on four uninterrupted   months of spiritual exploration.

p10802
S"It's reality-check time! You are at least five months into your tour of parenting duty by now. The complexity of child-training has begun to come into focus. You have learned that as your baby matures both constant and variable factors continually influence his or her development. What behaviors can and should you expect from your pretoddler? Feeding time for your pretoddler, for example, is now more than a response controlled by a sucking reflex. For the pretoddler, mealtime is part of a very complex, conscious interaction between what the child does and what his parents expect him to do. Right and wrong conduct will be encouraged, discouraged, and guided when necessary. In fact, right and wrong patterns of behavior will now be part of your baby's entire day. That's why feeding time, waketime and sleeptime provide wonderful opportunities for training and Babywise Book II will guide you all the way, from the high chair to playpen, from the living room to the back yard. This series teaches the practical side of introducing solids food, managing mealtimes, nap transitions, traveling with your infant, setting reasonable limits while encourage healthy exploration and much more. You will learn how to teach your child to use sign language for basic needs, a tool proven to help stimulate cognitive growth and advance communication. Apply the principles and your friends and relatives will be amazed at the alertness, contentedness and happy disposition of your baby"

How will that drive serve her off the court in her post-tennis career? For inspiration, Venus turned to nearly fifty business leaders, politicians, doctors, and artists, all of whom previously played competitive sports and who are now at the top of their professions, and asked them the essential questions: What principles that inspired you toward success as an athlete are helpful in life? In business?</p><p>Here an A-list group of visionaries, including eBay\'s former CEO Meg Whitman, Nike\'s co-founder Philip Knight, stateswoman Condoleezza Rice, entrepreneur and former NBA player Earvin "Magic" Johnson, and designer Vera Wang, respond with a useful array of tips woven through anecdotes from their athletic past that have been instrumental in their post\x96sports life success. Whether it\'s visualizing a course of action before it happens, turning losses into learning tools, figuring out who best plays what position in a team environment, or remembering that there is no substitute for preparation, the advice in <i>Come to Win</i> is knowledge every manager and aspiring professional will want to read. It\'s also an indispensable tool for parents and coaches looking to build confidence and discipline in their children.</p><p>Venus also reflects on what she has learned from her own coaches, including her father and mother, and how their wisdom contributes to her own remarkable achievements, from her history-making tennis career to the launch of her own businesses\x97V-Starr Interiors, an interior design firm, and EleVen, an athletic clothing line.</p>'

Peter and Valentine were candidates for the soldier-training program but didn\'t make the cut\x97young Ender is the Wiggin drafted to the orbiting Battle School for rigorous military training.<BR><BR>Ender\'s skills make him a leader in school and respected in the Battle Room, where children play at mock battles in zero gravity. Yet growing up in an artificial community of young soldiers Ender suffers greatly from isolation, rivalry from his peers, pressure from the adult teachers, and an unsettling fear of the alien invaders.

A routine will set up a calming sequence of events that will be designed to help the child relax.    <P><B>Problem: Toilet-training  Supernanny Solution:</B> Prepare your child by taking any hint of shame or disgust out of what is simply a natural fact of life. Keep the door open, bring her into the bathroom with you, and explain what's happening, including the use of toilet paper and the washing of hands afterward."

p10892
S"In this witty and infectious book, Madsen Pirie provides a complete guide to using - and indeed abusing - logic in order to win arguments. He identifies with devastating examples all the most common fallacies popularly used in argument. We all like to think of ourselves as clear-headed and logical - but all readers will find in this book fallacies of which they themselves are guilty. The author shows you how to simultaneously strengthen your own thinking and identify the weaknesses in other people's arguments. And, more mischievously, Pirie also shows how to be deliberately illogical - and get away with it. This book will make you maddeningly smart: your family, friends and opponents will all wish that you had never read it."

One of the best-known motivational books in history, Dale Carnegie's groundbreaking work has sold millions of copies, has been translated into almost every known written language, and has helped countless people succeed in both their business and personal lives.  <P> First published in 1937, Carnegie's advice has remained relevant for generations because he addresses timeless questions about the fine art of getting along with people: How can you make people like you instantly? How can you persuade people to agree with you? How can you speak frankly to people without giving offense? The ability to read others and successfully navigate any social situation is critically important to those who want to get a job, keep a job, or simply expand their social network.  <P> The core principles of this book, originally written as a practical, working handbook on human relations, are proven effective. Carnegie explains the fundamentals of handling people with a positive approach; how to make people like you and want to help you; how to win people to your way of thinking without conflict; and how to be the kind of leader who inspires quality work, increased productivity, and high morale.  <P> As Carnegie explains, the majority of our success in life depends on our ability to communicate and manage personal relationships effectively, whether at home or at work. <I>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i> will help you discover and develop the people skills you need to live well and prosper."

There\x92s the middle-aged wine merchant William, who\x92s trying to convince his reluctant twenty-four-year-old son, Eddie, to leave the nest; and Marcia, the boutique caterer who has her sights set on William. There\x92s also the (justifiably) much-loathed Member of Parliament Oedipus Snark; his mother, Berthea, who\x92s writing his biography and hating every minute of it; and his long-suffering girlfriend, Barbara, a literary agent who would like to be his wife (but, then, she\x92d like to be almost anyone\x92s wife).

S"Announcing a brand new, cover-to-cover revision of America's pregnancy bible. <i>What to Expect When You're Expecting</i> is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years. It's read by more than 90% of pregnant women who read a pregnancy book\x97the most iconic, must-have book for parents-to-be, with over 14.5 million copies in print.<br> <br> Now comes the Fourth Edition, a new book for a new generation of expectant moms\x97featuring a new look, a fresh perspective, and a friendlier-than-ever voice. It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk food\x96dependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be.<br> <br> Overflowing with tips, helpful hints, and humor (a pregnant woman's best friend), this new edition is more accessible and easier to use than ever before. It's everything parents-to-be have come to expect from What to Expect...only better?."

p11053
S'What do Natalie Portman, Robert Downey, Jr., Zach Braff, and Mandy Moore have in common? Before they were stars, they were campers at Stagedoor Manor, the premier summer theater camp for children and teenagers. Founded in 1975, Stagedoor continues to attract scores of young performers eager to find kindred spirits, to sing out loud, to become working actors\x97or maybe even stars. <P>Every summer for the past thirty-five years, a new crop of campers has come to the Catskills for an intense, often wrenching introduction to professional theater. (The camp produces thirteen full-scale productions during each of its three sessions.) These kids come from varying backgrounds\x97the offspring of Hollywood players from Nora Ephron to Bruce Willis work alongside kids on scholarship. Some campers have agents, others are seeking representation. <P>When Mickey Rapkin, a senior editor at <I>GQ </I>and self-proclaimed theater fanatic, learned about this place, he fled Manhattan for an escape to upstate New York. At Stagedoor, he tracked a trio of especially talented and determined teen actors through their final session at camp. Enter Rachael Singer, Brian Muller, and Harry Katzman, three high school seniors closing out their sometimes sheltered Stagedoor experiences and graduating into the real world of industry competition and rejection. These veteran campers\x97still battling childhood insecurities, but simultaneously searching for that professional gig that will catapult them to fame\x97pour their souls into what might be their last amateur shows. <P><P>Their riveting stories are told in <I>Theater Geek</I>, an eye-opening, laugh-out-loud chronicle full of drama and heart, but also about the business of training kids to be professional thespians and, in some cases, child stars. (The camp has long acted as a farm system for Broadway and Hollywood, attracting visits from studio executives and casting directors.) Via original interviews with former and current campers and staff\x97including Mandy Moore, Zach Braff, and Jon Cryer\x97Rapkin also recounts Stagedoor Manor\x92s colorful, star-studded history: What was Natalie Portman\x92s breakout role as a camper? What big-time Hollywood director, then barely a teenager, dated a much older Stagedoor staff member? Why did Courtney Love (at Stagedoor visiting her daughter) get into an argument with a hot dog vendor who had set up shop at the camp? <P><I><P>Theater Geek </I>leads readers through the triumphs and tragedies of the three senior campers\x92 final summer in an absorbing, thought-provoking narrative that reveals the dynamic and inspiring human beings who populate this world. It also explores what the proliferation of theater camps says about our celebrity-obsessed youth and our most basic but vital need to fit in. Through the rivalry, heartbreak, and joy of one summer at Stagedoor Manor, Rapkin offers theater geeks of all ages a dishy, illuminating romp through the lives of serious child actors. Rich, insightful, and thoroughly entertaining, <I>Theater Geek </I>pulls back the curtain on an elite and intriguing world to reveal what\x92s really at its core: children who simply love to perform.'

Drawing examples from his own field of psychology, he shows   readers how to overcome motivational roadblocks and become prolific without   sacrificing evenings, weekends, and vacations. After describing strategies   for writing productively, the author gives detailed advice from the   trenches on how to write, submit, revise, and resubmit articles; how to   improve writing quality; and how to write and publish academic work.'

p11132
S'Too often math gets a bad rap, characterized as dry and difficult. But, Alex Bellos says, "math can be inspiring and brilliantly creative. Mathematical thought is one of the great achievements of the human race, and arguably the foundation of all human progress. The world of mathematics is a remarkable place."Bellos has traveled all around the globe and has plunged into history to uncover fascinating stories of mathematical achievement, from the breakthroughs of Euclid, the greatest mathematician of all time, to the creations of the Zen master of origami, one of the hottest areas of mathematical work today. Taking us into the wilds of the Amazon, he tells the story of a tribe there who can count only to five and reports on the latest findings about the math instinct\x97including the revelation that ants can actually count how many steps they\x92ve taken. Journeying to the Bay of Bengal, he interviews a Hindu sage about the brilliant mathematical insights of the Buddha, while in Japan he visits the godfather of Sudoku and introduces the brainteasing delights of mathematical games.Exploring the mysteries of randomness, he explains why it is impossible for our iPods to truly randomly select songs. In probing the many intrigues of that most beloved of numbers, pi, he visits with two brothers so obsessed with the elusive number that they built a supercomputer in their Manhattan apartment to study it. Throughout, the journey is enhanced with a wealth of intriguing illustrations, such as of the clever puzzles known as tangrams and the crochet creation of an American math professor who suddenly realized one day that she could knit a representation of higher dimensional space that no one had been able to visualize. <P>Whether writing about how algebra solved Swedish traffic problems, visiting the Mental Calculation World Cup to disclose the secrets of lightning calculation, or exploring the links between pineapples and beautiful teeth, Bellos is a wonderfully engaging guide who never fails to delight even as he edifies. <I>Here\x92s Looking at Euclid </I>is a rare gem that brings the beauty of math to life.'

S'Candid, outspoken, laugh-out-loud funny essays from the much-loved Samantha Bee, the Most Senior Correspondent on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . <P><P>Critics have called her \x93sweet, adorable, and vicious.\x94 But there is so much more to be said about Samantha Bee. For one, she\x92s Canadian. Whatever that means. And now, she opens up for the very first time about her checkered Canadian past. With charming candor, she admits to her Lennie from <I>Of Mice and Men</I>\x96style love of baby animals, her teenage crime spree as one-half of a car-thieving couple (Bonnie and Clyde in Bermuda shorts and braces), and the fact that strangers seem compelled to show her their genitals. She also details her intriguing career history, which includes stints working in a frame store, at a penis clinic, and as a Japanese anime character in a touring children\x92s show. <P><P>Samantha delves into all these topics and many more in this thoroughly hilarious, unabashedly frank collection of personal essays. Whether detailing the creepiness that ensues when strangers assume that your mom is your lesbian lover, or recalling her girlhood crush on Jesus (who looked like Kris Kristofferson and sang like Kenny Loggins), Samantha turns the spotlight on her own imperfect yet highly entertaining life as relentlessly as she skewers hapless interview subjects on <I>The Daily Show</I>. She shares her unique point of view on a variety of subjects as wide ranging as her deep affinity for old people, to her hatred of hot ham. It\x92s all here, in irresistible prose that will leave you in stitches and eager for more.'

p11142
S'<b>A rare mix of wit, social satire, and suspense, along with characters who leap from the page to speak directly to the reader -- a moving story about a love that just won\'t give up, <I>As Husbands Go</i> is the latest from critically acclaimed, bestselling author, Susan Isaacs.</b>  <P> Call her superficial, but Susie B. Anthony Rabinowitz Gersten assumed her marriage was great -- and why not? Jonah Gersten, M.D., a Park Avenue plastic surgeon, clearly adored her. He was handsome, successful, and a doting dad to their four-year-old triplets Dashiell, Evan, and Mason. But when Jonah is found in the Upper East Side apartment of second-rate "escort" Dorinda Dillon, Susie is overwhelmed with questions left unanswered. It\'s bad enough to know your husband\'s been murdered, but even worse when you\'re universally pitied (and quietly mocked) because of the sleaze factor. None of it makes sense to Susie -- not a sexual liaison with someone like Dorinda, not the "better not to discuss it" response from Jonah\'s partners. With help from her toughtalking, high-style Grandma Ethel who flies in from Miami, she takes on her snooty in-laws, her husband\'s partners, the NYPD, and the DA (is the person arrested for the homicide the actual perp, or just an easy mark for a prosecutor who hates the word "unsolved"?), as she tries to prove that her wonderful life with Jonah was no lie. Susan Isaacs brilliantly turns the conventions of the mystery on end as Susie Gersten, suburban mom, floral designer, and fashion plate, searches not so much for answers to her husband\'s death as for answers to her own life.'

Underhill offers a tour of the world\x92s marketplace\x97with shrewd observations and practical applications to help everybody adapt to the new realities. As large numbers of women become steadily wealthier, more powerful, and more independent, their choices and preferences are transforming our commercial environment in a variety of important ways, from the cars we drive to the food we eat; from how we buy and furnish our homes to how we gamble, play, and use the Internet\x97in short, how we spend our time and money. With the same flair and humor that made his previous books universally appealing, Underhill examines how a woman\x92s role as homemaker has evolved into homeowner and what women look for in a home. How the home gym and home office are linked to the women\x92s health movement and home-based businesses. Why the refrigerator has trumped the stove as the crucial appliance. How every major hotel chain in the world has redesigned rooms and services for the female business traveler. Why some malls, appealing to women, are succeeding while others fail. What women look for online and why some retail websites, like Amazon, attract women while other sites turn them off. "The point is," writes Underhill, "while men were busy doing other things, women were becoming a major social, cultural, and economic force." <P>And, as he warns, no business can afford to ignore their power and presence.'

These mercenary entrepreneurs have taken advantage of an era of deregulation to devise high-priced products to sell to the credit-hungry working poor, including the instant tax refund and the payday loan. In the process they've created an industry larger than the casino business and have proved that pawnbrokers and check cashers, if they dream big enough, can grow very rich off those with thin wallets.</p><p><i>Broke, USA</i> is Gary Rivlin's riveting report from the economic fringes. From the annual meeting of the national check cashers association in Las Vegas to a tour of the foreclosure-riddled neighborhoods of Dayton, Ohio, here is a subprime Fast Food Nation featuring an unforgettable cast of characters and memorable scenes. Rivlin profiles players like a former small-town Tennessee debt collector whose business offering cash advances to the working poor has earned him a net worth in the hundreds of millions, and legendary Wall Street dealmaker Sandy Weill, who rode a subprime loan business into control of the nation's largest bank. Rivlin parallels their stories with the tale of those committed souls fighting back against the major corporations, chain franchises, and newly hatched enterprises that fleece the country's hardworking waitresses, warehouse workers, and mall clerks.</p><p>Timely, shocking, and powerful, <i>Broke, USA</i> offers a much-needed look at why our country is in a financial mess and gives a voice to the millions of ordinary Americans left devastated in the wake of the economic collapse.</p>"

Change the debate and you change the country. <P>For Noah Gardner, a twentysomething public relations executive, it\x92s safe to say that political theory is the furthest thing from his mind. Smart, single, handsome, and insulated from the world\x92s problems by the wealth and power of his father, Noah is far more concerned about the future of his social life than the future of his country. <P>But all of that changes when Noah meets Molly Ross, a woman who is consumed by the knowledge that the America we know is about to be lost forever. She and her group of patriots have vowed to remember the past and fight for the future\x97but Noah, convinced they\x92re just misguided conspiracy-theorists, isn\x92t interested in lending his considerable skills to their cause. <P>And then the world changes. <P>An unprecedented attack on U.S. soil shakes the country to the core and puts into motion a frightening plan, decades in the making, to transform America and demonize all those who stand in the way. Amidst the chaos, many don\x92t know the difference between conspiracy theory and conspiracy fact\x97or, more important, which side to fight for. <P>But for Noah, the choice is clear: Exposing the plan, and revealing the conspirators behind it, is the only way to save both the woman he loves and the individual freedoms he once took for granted. <P>After five back-to-back #1 New York Times bestsellers, national radio and Fox News television host Glenn Beck has delivered a ripped-from-the-headlines thriller that seamlessly weaves together American history, frightening facts about our present condition, and a heart-stopping plot. The Overton Window will educate, enlighten, and, most important, entertain\x97with twists and revelations <P>no one will see coming.'

p11242
S'What Makes God Cry The Most (Things You Really Should Know About Abortion) is a nonjudgmental writing in which the author provides factual information so readers have a good understanding, and are better able to form their own opinions, for decisions they may have to make.    The book is concise and readable and presents information in important areas, including the nature and development of the unborn child, the way we think, the law, abortion methods, pain which the unborn baby may feel, problems which individuals may have after an abortion, help and support which are available, and a final summary chapter which encourages choosing life.    This is what women and men should know while making decisions on whether to choose to continue pregnancy and to parent; or choosing adoptive services, which is another loving decision which will ensure that their child can have the opportunity to live a full life.    What Makes God Cry The Most addresses this subject in the only place where it is meaningful \x96 in the hearts and minds of the women and men who will make a decision on whether to carry a pregnancy to term.

S"A Fascinating journey into the heart and culture of a reclusive religious community.    I Am Hutterite takes readers into the hidden heart of the little-known Hutterite colony in southern Manitoba where author Mary-Ann Kirkby spent her childhood. When she was ten years old her parents packed up their seven children and a handful of possessions and left the security of the colony to start a new life. Overnight they were thrust into a world they didn't understand, a world that did not understand them.    Before she left the colony Mary-Ann had never tasted macaroni and cheese or ridden a bike. She had never heard of Walt Disney or rock-and-roll. She was forced to reinvent herself, denying her heritage to fit in with her peers. With great humor, Kirkby describes how she adapted to popular culture; and with raw honesty her family's deep sense of loss for their community. More than a history lesson, I Am Hutterite is a powerful tale of retracing steps and understanding how our beginnings often define us.     Controversial and acclaimed by the Hutterite community, Kirkby's book unveils the rich history and traditions of her people, giving us a rare and intimate portrait of an extraordinary way of life."

S"Do lobsters feel pain? Did Franz Kafka have a funny bone? What is John Updike's deal, anyway? And what happens when adult video starlets meet their fans in person? David Foster Wallace answers these questions and more in essays that are also enthralling narrative adventures. Whether covering the three-ring circus of a vicious presidential race, plunging into the wars between dictionary writers, or confronting the World's Largest Lobster Cooker at the annual Maine Lobster Festival, Wallace projects a quality of thought that is uniquely his and a voice as powerful and distinct as any in American letters."

S'C alling <I>T is for Trespass</I> "taut, terrifying, transfixing and terrific," USA Today went on to ask, "What does it take to write twenty novels about the same character and manage to create a fresh, genre-bending novel every time?" It\'s a question worth pondering. Through twenty excursions into the dark side of the human soul, Sue Grafton has never written the same book twice. And so it is with this, her twenty-first. Once again, she breaks genre formulas, giving us a twisting, complex, surprise-filled, and totally satisfying thriller.<BR><BR> It\'s April, 1988, a month before Kinsey Millhone\'s thirty-eighth birthday, and she\'s alone in her office doing paperwork when a young man arrives unannounced. He has a preppy air about him and looks as if he\'d be carded if he tried to buy booze, but Michael Sutton is twenty-seven, an unemployed college dropout. Twenty-one years earlier, a four-year-old girl disappeared. A recent reference to her kidnapping has triggered a flood of memories. Sutton now believes he stumbled on her lonely burial when he was six years old. He wants Kinsey\'s help in locating the child\'s remains and finding the men who killed her. It\'s a long shot but he\'s willing to pay cash up front, and Kinsey agrees to give him one day. As her investigation unfolds, she discovers Michael Sutton has an uneasy relationship with the truth. In essence, he\'s the boy who cried wolf. Is his current story true or simply one more in a long line of fabrications?<BR><BR> Grafton moves the narrative between the eighties and the sixties, changing points of view, building multiple subplots, and creating memorable characters. Gradually, we see how they all connect. But at the beating center of the novel is Kinsey Millhone, sharp-tongued, observant, a loner-"a heroine," said <I>The New York Times Book Review</I>, "with foibles you can laugh at and faults you can forgive."'

p11415
S'Don\x92t Think of An Elephant! is the antidote to the last forty years of conservative strategizing and the right wing\x92s stranglehold on political dialogue in the United States.    <P>Author George Lakoff explains how conservatives think, and how to counter their arguments. He outlines in detail the traditional American values that progressives hold, but are often unable to articulate. Lakoff also breaks down the ways in which conservatives have framed the issues, and provides examples of how progressives can reframe the debate.    <P>Lakoff\x92s years of research and work with environmental and political leaders have been distilled into this essential guide, which shows progressives how to think in terms of values instead of programs, and why people vote their values and identities, often against their best interests.    <P>Don\x92t Think of an Elephant! is the definitive handbook for understanding and communicating effectively about key issues in the 2004 election, and beyond.    <P>Read it, take action\x97and help take America back.    <P>About the Author  George Lakoff is the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Professor of Cognitive Science and Linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, and is a founding senior fellow at the Rockridge Institute. He is one of the world\x92s best-known linguists.    <P>Since the mid-1980s he has been applying cognitive linguistics to the study of politics, especially the framing of public political debate. He is the author of the influential book, Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think, (2nd edition, 2002). His other books include Women, Fire, and Dangerous Things: What Categories Reveal About The Mind (1987), Metaphors We Live By (1980; 2003) [with Mark Johnson], More Than Cool Reason (1989) [with Mark Turner], Philosophy in the Flesh: The Embodied Mind and Its Challenge To The Western Tradition (1999) [with Mark Johnson], and Where Mathematics Comes From: How the Embodied Mind Brings Mathematics Into Being (2000) [with Rafael N\xfa\xf1ez].'

One day she intercepted a note with an ugly racial caricature, and angrily declared that this was precisely the sort of thing that led to the Holocaust\x97only to be met by uncomprehending looks. So she and her students, using the treasured books <i>Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl</i> and <i>Zlata\x92s Diary: A Child\x92s Life in Sarajevo</i> as their guides, undertook a life-changing, eye-opening, spirit-raising odyssey against intolerance and misunderstanding.  They learned to see the parallels in these books to their own lives, recording their thoughts and feelings in diaries and dubbing themselves the \x93Freedom Writers\x94 in homage to the civil rights activists \x93The Freedom Riders.\x94<br><br>With funds raised by a \x93Read-a-thon for Tolerance,\x94 they arranged for Miep Gies, the courageous Dutch woman who sheltered the Frank family, to visit them in California, where she declared that Erin Gruwell\x92s students were \x93the real heroes.\x94 Their efforts have paid off spectacularly, both in terms of recognition\x97appearances on \x93Prime Time Live\x94 and \x93All Things Considered,\x94 coverage in <i>People</i> magazine, a meeting with U.S. Secretary of Education Richard Riley\x97and educationally. All 150 Freedom Writers have graduated from high school and are now attending college.<br><br>With powerful entries from the students\x92 own diaries and a narrative text by Erin Gruwell, <i>The Freedom Writers Diary</i> is an uplifting, unforgettable example of how hard work, courage, and the spirit of determination changed the lives of a teacher and her students. <br><br>The authors\x92 proceeds from this book will be donated to The Tolerance Education Foundation, an organization set up to pay for the Freedom Writers\x92 college tuition.

What do I exist for? Where can I find joy? We need to provide our children with a consistent, persuasive, biblical framework for understanding the world God has made and their place in it. Instructing a Child's Heart is essential to Shepherding a Child's Heart. The instruction that you provide for them not only informs their mind; it is directed to persuading their hearts of the wisdom and truthfulness of God s ways. Impress truth on the hearts of your children, not to control or manage them, but to point them to the greatest joy and happiness that they can experience delighting in God and the goodness of his ways."

(S'Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ, The'
p11525
S'The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is the remarkable new piece of fiction from best-selling and famously atheistic author Philip Pullman. By challenging the events of the gospels, Pullman puts forward his own compelling and plausible version of the life of Jesus, and in so doing, does what all great books do: makes the reader ask questions.      In Pullman-s own words, -The story I tell comes out of the tension within the dual nature of Jesus Christ, but what I do with it is my responsibility alone. Parts of it read like a novel, parts like history, and parts like a fairy tale; I wanted it to be like that because it is, among other things, a story about how stories become stories.-      Written with unstinting authority, The Good Man Jesus and the Scoundrel Christ is a pithy, erudite, subtle, and powerful book by a controversial and beloved author. It is a text to be read and reread, studied and unpacked, much like the Good Book itself.'
